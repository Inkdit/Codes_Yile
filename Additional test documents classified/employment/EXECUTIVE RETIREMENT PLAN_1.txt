EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN
The Executive Retirement Plan (ERP) is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The Plan is structured to qualify for certain exemptions from the eligibility, funding and other requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and, further, ERP benefits are computed without regard to compensation limits imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.
Article I. Purpose; Administration; and Effective Date
Article I, Section I. Purpose of the Plan
The purpose of the General Motors Executive Retirement Plan (the Plan) is to help provide eligible retiring salaried executive employees of General Motors Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation") as well as eligible retiring executive employees of General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) and General Motors Asset Management (GMAM) an overall level of monthly retirement benefits, or lump sum distributions of account balances, which are competitive with the benefits provided executives retiring from other major U.S. industrial companies. To achieve this goal, the monthly retirement benefits determined under the tax-qualified General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees (hereinafter referred to as the "Retirement Program"), or account balances determined under the tax-qualified Savings-Stock Purchase Program (hereinafter referred to as the "S-SPP") plus any benefits payable under certain other GM-provided benefit programs, may be supplemented by benefits provided under the formulas of this Plan. It is intended that this Plan, in relevant part, qualify as an "excess benefit plan" under Section 3(36) of ERISA and, in relevant part, as a plan "providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" under Section 201(2) of ERISA.

Article II, Section VI. (c) (3)
 (3) In the event of disability as defined in Article II, Section VI (a) (1) above, the monthly value of benefits under Article II of this Plan shall be unreduced for early age receipt and converted to a five year monthly annuity using the following methodology:
 a) First, offset the lifetime monthly annuity value of benefits under this Article II by the amount of any Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) payable to age 65 to determine the amount of monthly ERP and frozen SERP payable to age 65, if any.
 1) For this purpose, the conversion of any Article II, Section V ERP to a lifetime monthly annuity will use the discount rate specified in Article II, Section VI (c) (5) below in effect at the date of total and permanent disability retirement.
 b) Second, convert the monthly value of benefits determined in Article II, Section VI (c) (3) a) above to a five year monthly annuity using age at effective date of total and permanent disability retirement.  c) Third, convert the lifetime monthly annuity value of benefits under this Article II payable from age 65 to a five year annuity using age 65 as the effective date of payment.  d) Fourth, add the five year annuity values calculated in Article II, Section VI (c) (3) (b) plus Article II, Section VI (c) (3) (c) above to determine the total amount of the five year annuity payment.
 (4) Early receipt reduction factors will be identical to those used under the terms of the Retirement Program.20

Article II, Section VI. (c) (5)
 (5) The conversion of the monthly value of any benefits determined under Article II, Section II, III and IV (after applying any reduction for early age receipt) to a five year annuity form of payment, shall be made using the July average of the 30-year U.S. Treasury Securities rate and the same mortality tables applicable under the Retirement Program at date of separation from service. The discount rate will be redetermined each year as the average of the 30-year U.S. Treasury Securities rate for the month of July and be effective for retirements commencing October 1 following each redetermination through September 30 of the succeeding year. The defined contribution benefits under Article II, Section V for executives with a length of service date on or after January 1, 2001, will not use a mortality table for the conversion to a five year annuity form of payment.  (6) Should the executive die during the five year annuity payment period, the remaining five year annuity payments will be converted to a one-time lump sum and paid to a beneficiary named at date of retirement. If the executive is married at date of retirement spousal consent will be required to name a beneficiary other than the spouse. If the primary beneficiary has predeceased the executive, any contingent beneficiaries designated for the executive's Basic Group Life Insurance will receive the lump sum payment. If more than one person is named as the eligible beneficiary for the executive's Basic Group Life Insurance at date of death, the lump sum will be paid at the percentages designated for their respective interests as eligible beneficiaries of the executive's Basic Group Life Insurance. If their respective interests are not specified, their interests shall be several and equal. If a non-living entity such as a trust is named as beneficiary, or the executive should have no living beneficiary, any remaining five year annuity payments will be converted to a one-time lump sum for final payment.21
