         (b) If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any request pursuant to Section 2.4 and the Company shall include such information in the written notice referred to in Section 2.2(a) or Section 2.4(a), as applicable. In such event, the right of any Holder to include its Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein.

interest of the Initiating Holders (which underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.2 or Section 2.4, if the underwriter advises the Company that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten (including Registrable Securities) then the Company shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated to the Holders of such Registrable Securities on a pro rata basis based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all such Holders (including the Initiating Holders). Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from the registration.
         (c) The Company shall not be required to effect a registration pursuant to this Section 2.2:
　　　　　　　(i) prior to the earlier of (A) the third (3rd) anniversary of the date of this Agreement or (B) one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of the registration statement pertaining to the Initial Offering;
　　　　　　　(ii) after the Company has effected two (2) registrations pursuant to this Section 2.2, and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective;
　　　　　　　(iii) during the period starting with the date of filing of, and ending on the date one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of the registration statement pertaining to the Initial Offering, other than pursuant to a Special Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company makes reasonable good faith efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and provided further that, in the case of a public offering other than the Initial Offering, the Initiating Holders were permitted to register such shares as requested to be registered pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof without reduction by the underwriter thereof;
　　　　　　　(iv) if within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request from Initiating Holders pursuant to Section 2.2(a), the Company gives notice to the Holders of the Company's intention to file a registration statement for a public offering, other than pursuant to a Special Registration Statement within ninety (90) days;
　　　　　　　(v) if the Company shall furnish to Holders requesting a registration statement pursuant to this Section 2.2, a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to be effected at such time, in which event the Company shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the Initiating Holders; provided, however, that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the Company not more than twice in any twelve (12) month period;
　　　　　　　(vi) if the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of shares of Registrable Securities that may be immediately registered on Form S-3 pursuant to a request made pursuant to Section 2.4 below; or

　　2.3 Piggyback Registrations. The Company shall notify all Holders of Registrable Securities in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to the filing of any registration statement under the Securities Act for purposes of a public offering of securities of the Company (including, but not limited to, registration statements relating to secondary offerings of securities of the Company (including, but not limited to, any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 2.2), but excluding Special Registration Statements) and will afford each such Holder an opportunity to include in such registration statement all or part of such Registrable Securities held by such Holder. Each Holder desiring to include in any such registration statement all or any part of the Registrable Securities held by it shall, within fifteen (15) days after the above-described notice from the Company, so notify the Company in writing. Such notice shall state the intended method of disposition of the Registrable Securities by such Holder. If a Holder decides not to include all of its Registrable Securities in any registration statement thereafter filed by the Company, such Holder shall nevertheless continue to have the right to include any Registrable Securities in any subsequent registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by the Company with respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein.
         (a) Underwriting. If the registration statement of which the Company gives notice under this Section 2.3 is for an underwritten offering, the Company shall so advise the Holders of Registrable Securities. In such event, the right of any such Holder to include Registrable Securities in a registration pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the underwriter determines in good faith that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated, first, to the Company; second, to the Holders on a pro rata basis based on the total number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders; and third, to any stockholder of the Company (other than a Holder) on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no Registrable Securities being sold pursuant to Section 2.2 shall be excluded from the underwriting under any circumstances; and provided, further, that no such reduction shall reduce the amount of securities of the selling Holders included in the registration below twenty-five percent (25%) of the total amount of securities included in such registration, unless such offering is the Initial Offering and such registration does not include shares of any other selling stockholders, in which event any or all of the Registrable Securities of the Holders may be excluded in accordance with the immediately preceding clause. If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the underwriter, delivered at least ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration. For any Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, the partners, retired partners, members, retired members and stockholders of such Holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners, retired partners, members and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing person shall be deemed to be a single "Holder," and any pro rata reduction with respect to such "Holder" shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities and individuals included in such "Holder," as defined in this sentence.
         (b) Right to Terminate Registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 2.3 whether or not any Holder has elected to include securities in such registration. The Registration Expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof.

　　2.4 Form S-3 Registration. In case the Company shall receive from any Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities a written request or requests that the Company effect a registration on Form S-3 (or any successor to Form S-3) or any similar short-form registration statement and any related qualification or compliance with respect to all or a part of the Registrable Securities owned by such Holder or Holders, the Company will:
         (a) promptly give written notice of the proposed registration, and any related qualification or compliance, to all other Holders of Registrable Securities; and
         (b) as soon as practicable, effect such registration and all such qualifications and compliances as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of all or such portion of such Holder's or Holders' Registrable Securities as are specified in such request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities of any other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice from the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this Section 2.4:
　　　　　　　(i) if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the Holders;
　　　　　　　(ii) if the Holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate price to the public of less than one million dollars ($1,000,000);
　　　　　　　(iii) if within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request from any Holder or Holders pursuant to this Section 2.4, the Company gives notice to such Holder or Holders of the Company's intention to make a public offering within ninety (90) days, other than pursuant to a Special Registration Statement;
　　　　　　　(iv) if the Company shall furnish to the Holders a certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such Form S-3 registration to be effected at such time, in which event the Company shall have the right to defer the filing of the Form S-3 registration statement for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the Holder or Holders under this Section 2.4;provided, however, that such right to delay a request shall be exercised by the Company not more than twice in any twelve (12) month period;
　　　　　　　(v) if the Company has, within the twelve (12) month period preceding the date of such request, already effected two (2) registrations on Form S-3 for the Holders pursuant to this Section 2.4; or
　　　　　　　(vi) in any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to qualify to do business or to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, qualification or compliance.
 
7.

         (c) Subject to the foregoing, the Company shall file a Form S-3 registration statement covering the Registrable Securities and other securities so requested to be registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the requests of the Holders. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall not be counted as demands for registration or registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.2.
　　2.5 Expenses of Registration. Except as specifically provided herein, all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to Section 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4 herein shall be borne by the Company. All Selling Expenses incurred in connection with any registrations hereunder, shall be borne by the holders of the securities so registered pro rata on the basis of the number of shares so registered. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 2.2 or 2.4, the request of which has been subsequently withdrawn by the Initiating Holders unless (a) the withdrawal is based upon material adverse information concerning the Company of which the Initiating Holders were not aware at the time of such request or (b) the Holders of a majority of Registrable Securities agree to forfeit their right to one requested registration pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.4, as applicable, in which event such right shall be forfeited by all Holders). If the Holders are required to pay the Registration Expenses, such expenses shall be borne by the holders of securities (including Registrable Securities) requesting such registration in proportion to the number of shares for which registration was requested. If the Company is required to pay the Registration Expenses of a withdrawn offering pursuant to clause (a) above, then the Holders shall not forfeit their rights pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section 2.4 to a demand registration.
　　2.6 Obligations of the Company. Whenever required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:
         (a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use all reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for up to thirty (30) days or, if earlier, until the Holder or Holders have completed the distribution related thereto; provided, however, that at any time, upon written notice to the participating Holders and for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days thereafter (the "Suspension Period"), the Company may delay the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement or suspend the use or effectiveness of any registration statement (and the Initiating Holders hereby agree not to offer or sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement during the Suspension Period) if the Company reasonably believes that there is or may be in existence material nonpublic information or events involving the Company, the failure of which to be disclosed in the prospectus included in the registration statement could result in a Violation (as defined below). In the event that the Company shall exercise its right to delay or suspend the filing or effectiveness of a registration hereunder, the applicable time period during which the registration statement is to remain effective shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Suspension Period. The Company may extend the Suspension Period for an additional consecutive sixty (60) days with the consent of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered under the applicable registration statement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If so directed by the Company, all Holders registering shares under such registration statement shall (i) not offer to sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement during the period in which the delay or suspension is in effect after receiving notice of such delay or suspension; and (ii) use their best efforts to deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such Holders' possession, of the prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

         (b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement for the period set forth in subsection (a) above.
         (c) Furnish to the Holders such number of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by them.
         (d) Use its reasonable efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders;provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions.
         (e) In the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter(s) of such offering. Each Holder participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such an agreement.
         (f) Notify each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing. The Company will use reasonable efforts to amend or supplement such prospectus in order to cause such prospectus not to include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing.
         (g) Use its reasonable efforts to furnish, on the date that such Registrable Securities are delivered to the underwriters for sale, if such securities are being sold through underwriters, (i) an opinion, dated as of such date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and (ii) a letter, dated as of such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering addressed to the underwriters.

any other Holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other Holder's partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such Holder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other such Holder, or partner, director, officer or controlling person of such other Holder may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements: (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement or incorporated reference therein, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act (collectively, a "Holder Violation"), in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Holder Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder under an instrument duly executed by such Holder and stated to be specifically for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other Holder, or partner, officer, director or controlling person of such other Holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if it is judicially determined that there was such a Holder Violation; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.8(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided further, that in no event shall any indemnity under this Section 2.8 exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder.
         (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.8 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.8, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses thereof to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such action shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section 2.8 to the extent, and only to the extent, prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.8.
         (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.8 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the Violation(s) or Holder Violation(s) that resulted in such loss,
 
11.

claim, damage or liability, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however,that in no event shall any contribution by a Holder hereunder exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder.
         (e) The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.8 shall survive completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement and, with respect to liability arising from an offering to which this Section 2.8 would apply that is covered by a registration filed before termination of this Agreement, such termination. No indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.
　　2.9 Assignment of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2 may be assigned by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of Registrable Securities (for so long as such shares remain Registrable Securities) that (a) is a subsidiary, parent, affiliate, general partner, limited partner, retired partner, member or retired member, of a Holder that is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, (b) is a Holder's family member or trust for the benefit of such Holder or one or more of his or her family members, or (c) acquires at least two percent (2%) of all Registrable Securities (as adjusted for stock splits and combinations); provided, however, that (i) the transferor shall, within ten (10) days after such transfer, furnish to the Company written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such transferee shall agree to be subject to all restrictions set forth in this Agreement.
　　2.10 Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights. Other than as provided in Section 5.10, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company that would grant such holder (i) rights to demand the registration of shares of the Company's capital stock, or to include such shares in a registration statement that would reduce the number of shares includable by the Holders or (ii) any other registration rights on parity with or senior to those granted to the Holders hereunder, other than the right to a Special Registration Statement.
　　2.11 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement.
         (a) Each Holder hereby agrees that such Holder shall not sell, transfer, make any short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale, any Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company held by such Holder (other than those disposed of in the registration and those acquired by the Holder in the registration or thereafter in open market transactions) for a period specified by the representative of the underwriters of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act; provided, however, that:
 
12.

　　　　　　　(i) such agreement shall apply only to the Company's Initial Offering; and
　　　　　　　(ii) all officers and directors of the Company and each other holder of at least one percent (1%) of the Company's voting securities enter into similar agreements.
         (b) Except for waivers concerning up to fifty thousand (50,000) shares of Common Stock, or options and warrants exercisable for Common Stock, (as adjusted for stock splits and combinations), if the Company waives or terminates any standoff or lockup restrictions imposed on any holder of securities of the Company, then such waiver or termination shall be granted to all Holders subject to standoff or lockup restrictions pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially held by such holder and the Holders. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use its best efforts to ensure that all holders of capital stock of the Company agree to be bound by terms substantially similar to those set forth in this Section 2.11.
　　2.12 Agreement to Furnish Information. Each Holder agrees to execute and deliver such other agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the underwriter that are consistent with the Holder's obligations under Section 2.11 or that are necessary to give further effect thereto. In addition, if requested by the Company or the representative of the underwriters of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company, each Holder shall provide, within ten (10) days of such request, such information as may be required by the Company or such representative in connection with the completion of any public offering of the Company's securities pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act. The obligations described in Section 2.11 and this Section 2.12 shall not apply to a Special Registration Statement. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the shares of Common Stock (or other securities) subject to the foregoing restriction until the end of said one hundred eighty (180) day period. Each Holder agrees that any transferee of any shares of Registrable Securities shall be bound by Sections 2.11 and 2.12. The underwriters of the Company's stock are intended third party beneficiaries of Sections 2.11 and 2.12 and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto.
　　2.13 Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the Company agrees to use its best efforts to:
         (a) Make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in SEC Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of the first registration filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the general public;
         (b) File with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Exchange Act; and
         (c) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish to such Holder forthwith upon request: a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said Rule 144 of the Securities Act, and of the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to such reporting requirements); a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company filed with the SEC; and such other reports and documents as a Holder may reasonably request in connection with availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing it to sell any such securities without registration.
 
13.

　　2.14 Termination of Registration Rights. The rights and obligations of each Investor contained in this Section 2 shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the earlier of (i) the date five (5) years following the closing of a Qualified IPO; or (ii) when all Investors (considered with their affiliates) can sell all of their Shares in a ninety-one (91) day period under Rule 144.

SECTION 4. RIGHTS OF FIRST REFUSAL.
　　4.1 Subsequent Offerings. Subject to applicable securities laws, each Major Investor shall have a right of first refusal to purchase its pro rata share of all Equity Securities, as defined below, that the Company may, from time to time, propose to sell and issue after the date of this Agreement, other than the Equity Securities excluded by Section 4.6 hereof. Each Major Investor's pro rata share is equal to the ratio of (a) the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issuable or issued upon conversion of the Shares or upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options) which such Investor is deemed to be a holder immediately prior to the issuance of
 
16.

such Equity Securities to (b) the total number of shares of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Shares or upon the exercise of any outstanding warrants or options) immediately prior to the issuance of the Equity Securities. The term "Equity Securities" shall mean (i) any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security of the Company, (ii) any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, with or without consideration, any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security (including any option to purchase such a convertible security), (iii) any security carrying any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase any Common Stock, Preferred Stock or other security or (iv) any such warrant or right.
　　4.2 Exercise of Rights. If the Company proposes to issue any Equity Securities, it shall give each Major Investor written notice of its intention, describing the Equity Securities, the price and the terms and conditions upon which the Company proposes to issue the same. Each Major Investor shall have twenty (20) days from the giving of such notice to agree to purchase its pro rata share of the Equity Securities for the price and upon the terms and conditions specified in the notice by giving written notice to the Company and stating therein the quantity of Equity Securities to be purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to offer or sell such Equity Securities to any Major Investor who would cause the Company to be in violation of applicable federal securities laws by virtue of such offer or sale.
　　4.3 Issuance of Equity Securities to Other Persons. If not all of the Major Investors elect to purchase their prorata shares of the Equity Securities, then the Company shall promptly notify in writing the Major Investors who do so elect and shall offer such Major Investors the right to acquire such unsubscribed shares on a pro rata basis. The Major Investors shall have five (5) days after receipt of such notice to notify the Company of its election to purchase all or a portion thereof of the unsubscribed shares. If the Major Investors fail to exercise in full the rights of first refusal, the Company shall have ninety (90) days thereafter to sell the Equity Securities in respect of which the Major Investor's rights were not exercised, at a price and upon general terms and conditions not materially more favorable to the purchasers thereof than specified in the Company's notice to the Major Investors pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof. If the Company has not sold such Equity Securities within ninety (90) days of the notice provided pursuant to Section 4.2, the Company shall not thereafter issue or sell any Equity Securities, without first offering such securities to the Major Investors in the manner provided above.
　　4.4 Termination and Waiver of Rights of First Refusal. The rights of first refusal established by this Section 4 shall not apply to, and shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the effective date of the registration statement pertaining to a Qualified IPO of the Company, (ii) the date the Company first becomes subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Sections 12(g) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or (iii) a Change in Control. Notwithstanding Section 5.5 hereof, the rights of first refusal established by this Section 4 may be amended, or any provision waived with the written consent of the Company and the Major Investors holding a majority of the Registrable Securities held by all Major Investors, or as permitted by Section 5.5.
　　4.5 Transfer of Rights of First Refusal. The rights of first refusal of each Major Investor under this Section 4 may be transferred to the same parties, subject to the same restrictions as any transfer of registration rights pursuant to Section 2.9.
　　4.6 Excluded Securities. The rights of first refusal established by this Section 4 shall have no application to any of the following Equity Securities:
 
17.

         (a) shares of Common Stock and/or options, warrants or other Common Stock purchase rights and the Common Stock issued pursuant to such options, warrants or other rights (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like after the filing of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) issued or to be issued after the Original Issue Date (as defined in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) to employees, officers or directors of, or consultants or advisors to the Company or any subsidiary, pursuant to stock purchase, stock bonus or stock option plans or other arrangements that are approved by the Board of Directors, which approval shall include the approval of at least one director elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock;
         (b) stock issued or issuable pursuant to any rights or agreements, options, warrants or convertible securities outstanding as of the date of this Agreement; and stock issued pursuant to any such rights or agreements granted after the date of this Agreement, so long as the rights of first refusal established by this Section 4 were complied with, waived, or were inapplicable pursuant to any provision of this Section 4.7 with respect to the initial sale or grant by the Company of such rights or agreements;
         (c) any Equity Securities issued pursuant to joint ventures, marketing or distribution arrangements, technology transfer or development arrangements, or other strategic transactions approved by the Board of Directors;
         (d) any Equity Securities issued for consideration other than cash pursuant to a bona fide merger, consolidation, acquisition or other similar business combination;
         (e) any Equity Securities issued in connection with any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction by the Company;
         (f) any Equity Securities issued pursuant to any equipment loan or leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, consulting agreement, debt financing from a bank or similar financial or lending institution or any other arrangement with a provider of goods and services approved by the Board of Directors;
         (g) any Equity Securities that are issued by the Company pursuant to a Qualified IPO;
         (h) any Equity Securities which, with the unanimous approval of the Board of Directors, are not offered to any existing security holders of the Company; or
         (i) any Equity Securities issued pursuant to any transaction approved by a majority of the Board of Directors, which approval shall include the approval of at least one director elected by the holders of the Preferred Stock.
