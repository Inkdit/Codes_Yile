WITNESSETH
 
       WHEREAS, Seller owns 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of the Company (the “Membership Interests”);
 
       WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to acquire, the Membership Interests, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement; and
 
       WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Seller Parent has delivered a guarantee of certain obligations of Seller, for the benefit of Purchaser (the “Guarantee”).
 
       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants hereinafter set forth, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:
 
ARTICLE I
 
PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS
 
1.1  Purchase and Sale of Membership Interests 
       Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and receive from such Seller, the Membership Interests.
 
1.2  Closing Payment 
       (a) At the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by delivery of immediately available funds, an amount equal to:
 
　　　　　　　　　　(i) $24,000,000, minus
 
　　　　　　　　　　(ii) the amount of Estimated Gift Card Cash, minus
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iii) the excess of the Target Net Working Capital over the Estimated Net Working Capital, minus
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iv) the Indemnity Escrow Amount.
 
The foregoing amount is referred to herein as the “Closing Payment”.  The Closing Payment as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.5, is referred to herein as the “Purchase Price”.  The Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance with Section 1.6.
 
       (b) At the Closing, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser shall pay to the Escrow Agent, by delivery of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

-1-

 
 
1.3  Closing 
       The closing (the “Closing”) of the sale and purchase of the Membership Interests shall take place at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, One Bryant Park, New York, NY 10036, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time on the date (the “Closing Date”) that is (a) two Business Days after all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms, are intended to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) or (b) such other date as mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller.  As of the time immediately before the Closing, the Company shall be deemed to have transferred and assigned to Seller all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to any and all cash and cash equivalents, including Gift Card Cash, then held by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller on behalf of the Company, which shall be duly reflected on the Company’s balance sheet. Such transfer shall not be deemed to be a change under Section 2.7, a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise be deemed to cause any representation or warranty of Seller to be inaccurate as of the Closing Date.
 
1.4  Closing Deliverables 
       (a) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser:
 
　　　　　　　　　　(i)  an Assignment of Membership Interest, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, duly executed by an officer of Seller;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(ii) a counterpart to each Related Document to which Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party, duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized representative of such Person;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iii) the written resignation of each director and officer of the Company, except for those persons whom Purchaser notifies Seller prior to Closing that it does not require to resign at Closing;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iv) a duly executed certificate of non-foreign status, dated as of the Closing Date, sworn under penalty of perjury and in form and substance required under Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code stating that SHC Parent Corp. is not a “foreign person” as defined in Section 1445 of the Code;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(v) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that each of the  consents and approvals set forth on Schedule 7.3(f) has been obtained and remains in full force and effect;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(vi) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that each of  the  consents and approvals from third parties that are not Governmental Authorities listed on Schedule 7.3(g) has been obtained and remains in full force and effect;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(vii) the certificate described in Section 7.3(d); and
 
　　　　　　　　　　(viii) a certificate dated as of the Closing Date, signed by a duly authorized officer of Seller, certifying to a true and complete list, as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, of Gift Card Cash from each Company client.
　　　　　　　　　　 
 
-2-

 
 
       (b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller:
 
　　　　　　　　　　(i) an amount equal to the Closing Payment, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Seller in writing no later than one day prior to the Closing Date;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(ii) a counterpart to each Related Document to which Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is a party, duly executed and delivered by a duly authorized representative of such Person; and
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iii) the certificate described in Section 7.2(c).
 
1.5  Post-Closing Adjustment 
       (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after Seller delivers the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 4.14, and in any event, within 90 days thereafter, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller (the “Closing Statements”) a calculation of aggregate Gift Card Cash as of the Closing Date (the “Actual Gift Card Cash”) and the Closing Net Working Capital.  The Closing Statements shall be prepared, and each Adjustment Amount shall be calculated, by aggregating each applicable and specified line item in the applicable Closing Statement.  For the avoidance of doubt, the process to prepare the Closing Statements shall be consistent with the financial reporting process applied in preparing the reviewed balance sheet of the Company as of July 27, 2014.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that the Closing Statements, and the component items thereof, shall be prepared and calculated in a manner consistent with Schedule 12.1(A) and the definition of Closing Net Working Capital and using the Agreed Accounting Policies, and shall not reflect any accounting principles, policies, methods, practices, categories, estimates, judgments or assumptions other than the Agreed Accounting Policies.
 
       (b) Seller shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser and Purchaser’s representatives in their preparation of, and provide Purchaser and Purchaser’s representatives with reasonable access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to, the relevant books, records (including workpapers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities, employees, and auditors of Seller Parent and its subsidiaries solely for purposes reasonably related to the preparation of the Closing Statements and the items included therein; and (ii) cooperate reasonably with Purchaser and Purchaser’s representatives in connection therewith, including providing, on a timely basis, all other information necessary or useful in connection with such preparation as is reasonably requested by Purchaser and Purchaser’s representatives; provided, however, that neither Seller nor the Seller Parent is under any obligation to disclose to Purchaser or the Company any information the disclosure of which is prohibited by applicable Law or that would result in the waiver of any attorney-client, work-product or other applicable privilege.
 
       (c) After receipt of the Closing Statements from Purchaser, Seller shall have 45 days to review the Closing Statements (the “Review Period”).  The Closing Statements shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Seller unless Seller shall have notified Purchaser in writing prior to the expiration of the Review Period of any dispute or objection thereto (any such written dispute or objection, an “Objection”), setting forth the basis for its dispute or objections and the specific adjustments (including dollar amounts) to the applicable Closing Statement that Seller believes, in good faith, should be made.  Any items not disputed or objected to in an Objection shall be deemed to have been accepted by Seller.  If no Objection is received by Purchaser from Seller prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Closing Statements shall be deemed to have been accepted by the parties and shall become final and binding upon the parties.  Seller and Purchaser shall, within 30 days (or such longer period as Seller and Purchaser may agree in writing) following delivery of an Objection to Purchaser (the “Resolution Period”), attempt in good faith to resolve their differences. All such discussions and communications related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, and any resolution by them agreed to in writing as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.  Any items agreed to by Seller and Purchaser in writing, together with any items specified in the Objection that are not disputed or objected to by Seller, are collectively referred to herein as the “Resolved Matters.”
 
 
-3-

 
        
       (d) If, at the end of the Resolution Period, Seller and Purchaser have been unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Objection, either Seller or Purchaser may refer all matters set forth in the Objection other than the Resolved Matters (the “Unresolved Matters”) to an internationally recognized independent public accounting firm jointly selected by Seller and Purchaser or, if Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree within five Business Days from the end of the Resolution Period, then such internationally recognized independent public accounting firm jointly selected by Seller’s and Purchaser’s independent accountants within five Business Days thereafter (the “CPA Firm”).  Seller and Purchaser each agree to promptly sign an engagement letter, in commercially reasonable form, as may reasonably be required by the CPA Firm.  The CPA Firm shall, acting as experts in accounting and not as arbitrators, determine on a basis consistent with the requirements of this Agreement, and only with respect to the Unresolved Matters so submitted, whether and to what extent the applicable Closing Statement requires adjustment.  Seller and Purchaser shall request the CPA Firm to use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) render its final written determination within 30 days after such firm’s engagement, and (ii) prepare the applicable Final Closing Statement (which shall be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the CPA Firm of the Unresolved Matters) and calculate the applicable Adjustment Amounts based on such Final Closing Statement.  The final written determination of the CPA Firm shall be based only on the written submissions by Seller and Purchaser, provided that Seller and Purchaser shall make reasonably available to the CPA Firm, upon the CPA Firm’s request, all relevant books and records, any workpapers (including those of the parties’ respective accountants) and supporting documentation relating to the applicable Closing Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA Firm (provided that they shall contemporaneously provide a copy to the other party of any materials requested by, and provided to, the CPA Firm). None of Seller, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates shall have any ex parte communications or meetings with the CPA Firm regarding the subject matter hereof without the other party’s prior written consent. The final written determination shall be made in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without regard to principles of equity.  With respect to each Unresolved Matter, the CPA Firm’s determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Seller or Purchaser, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by Seller or Purchaser with respect thereto.  The CPA Firm’s final written determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Seller and Purchaser.  Each “Final Closing Statement” shall be (I) in the event that no Objection is received by Purchaser from Seller prior to the expiration of the Review Period with respect thereto, the applicable Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 1.5(a); (II) in the event that an Objection is received by Purchaser from Seller prior to the expiration of the Review Period with respect to any Closing Statement, the applicable Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 1.5(a) as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Seller and Purchaser in writing; or (III) in the event that an Objection is received by Purchaser from Seller prior to the expiration of the Review Period and Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such Objection, the applicable Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 1.5(a) as adjusted by the CPA Firm to be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the CPA Firm of the Unresolved Matters in accordance with this Section 1.5(d).  In the event that any portion of the Final Closing Statement is determined (x) pursuant to clause (I) or (II) of the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall prepare the applicable Final Closing Statement and calculate the applicable Adjustment Amount, in each case, in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to Seller within three Business Days following the determination thereof, or (y) pursuant to clause (III) of the immediately preceding sentence, the CPA Firm shall prepare the applicable Final Closing Statement (which shall be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the CPA Firm of the Unresolved Matters) and calculate the applicable Adjustment Amount based on the applicable Final Closing Statement, in each case, in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to Seller and Purchaser within three Business Days following the delivery of the final written determination of the CPA Firm to Seller and Purchaser.
 
       (e) All fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in proportion to the amounts by which their respective calculations of the Closing Statement differ from the Closing Statement of the Company as finally determined by the CPA Firm.
 
 
-4-

 
 
       (f) Seller and Purchaser agree to the following adjustments to the Purchase Price (each such adjustment, an “Adjustment Amount”):
 
　　　　　　　　　　(i) if the Closing Net Working Capital (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement) is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Purchaser the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital and the Closing Net Working Capital (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement);
 
　　　　　　　　　　(ii) if the Closing Net Working Capital (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement) is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller or its designee the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement) and the Estimated Net Working Capital, up to a maximum amount of $1,400,000;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iii) if the Actual Gift Card Cash (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement) is less than the Estimated Gift Card Cash, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller the difference between the Estimated Gift Card Cash and the Actual Gift Card Cash (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement); and
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iv) if the Actual Gift Card Cash (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement) is greater than the Estimated Gift Card Cash, Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Purchaser the difference between the Actual Gift Card Cash (as set forth in the applicable Final Closing Statement) and the Estimated Gift Card Cash.
 
       (g) If any Person is required to make a payment pursuant to Section 1.5(f), it shall pay, within two Business Days of the delivery of the applicable Final Closing Statement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in dollars, to one or more accounts held by the Person to whom payment is required pursuant to Section 1.5(f), as designated by Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, in writing concurrently with the delivery of the applicable Final Closing Statement, an amount in cash equal to the Adjustment Amount.  If Purchaser on the one hand, or Seller on the other hand, is obligated to pay any amount to the other as contemplated in Section 1.5(f) and shall fail to do so within two Business Days of the delivery of the applicable Final Closing Statement, the person that was owed such unpaid amount(s) shall be entitled to seek enforcement of the payment of such unpaid amount(s) in the court identified in Section 10.10(b) pursuant to New York CPLR §7510, §7514 and §7601.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent agreed by Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, the parties may elect to offset any payments to be made by a party by any amounts due such party, in each case, pursuant to Section 1.5(f).
 
1.6  Allocation of Payment 
       (a) Any assumed liabilities and the sum of (x) the Purchase Price and (y) the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code (and any similar provision of state or local Law, as appropriate).  A statement setting forth such allocations (the “Statement of Allocation”) shall be prepared in good faith by Purchaser.  Purchaser shall deliver the Statement of Allocation to Seller within 90 days following the date of delivery of the Applicable Final Closing Statement in accordance with Section 1.5.  Purchaser and the Company shall provide Seller with (i) copies of all supplementary documents, working papers and other data of Purchaser and the Company relating to the Statement of Allocation and (ii) reasonable access to the employees of Purchaser and the Company who prepared the Statement of Allocation.  Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with Seller to provide Seller with such other information used in preparing the Statement of Allocation reasonably requested by Seller.  The Statement of Allocation shall be final and binding unless Purchaser receives from Seller a written notice of objection on or prior to the 30th day after delivery to Seller of the Statement of Allocation (the “Allocation Dispute Notice”).  The Allocation Dispute Notice shall state in reasonable detail the item or items in dispute.
 
 
-5-

 
 
       (b) In the event of a dispute regarding the Statement of Allocation, Purchaser and Seller shall each use reasonable efforts to resolve in writing any such objections, and any such resolution agreed to in writing by both shall be final and binding.  If Purchaser and Seller do not resolve any such dispute in writing within 45 days after Purchaser’s receipt of the Allocation Dispute Notice, then the parties shall promptly submit such unresolved dispute to the CPA Firm for resolution, which resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Seller.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any expenses related to the engagement of the CPA Firm in resolving the dispute regarding the allocation pursuant to Section 1.6(a) shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in proportion to the amounts by which their respective allocations differ from the allocation of the Purchase Price as finally determined by the CPA Firm.  Purchaser and Seller shall each bear the fees of their respective accountants and advisors incurred in connection with the determination and review of the Statement of Allocation.
 
       (c) Once the Statement of Allocation has become final and binding, Purchaser and Seller shall report, act and file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594, if required) in all respects and for all purposes consistent with the allocations on the Statement of Allocation.  Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall notify and provide the other with reasonable assistance in the event of an examination, audit or other proceeding regarding the allocations determined pursuant to this Section 1.6.  None of the parties shall take any action inconsistent with the Statement of Allocation prepared in accordance with this Section 1.6, unless otherwise required by Law.
 
1.7  Earn-Out. 
       (a) As additional consideration for the Membership Interests, at such time as provided in Section 1.7(f), Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount, not to exceed $3,900,000, if any (the “Earn-Out Payment”), equal to five (5) times the Contribution Margin Calculation. “Contribution Margin Calculation” means (x) the amount of Contribution Margin from sales by the Business to its partners set forth on Schedule 1.7(a)(i) for the twelve-month period immediately following the Baseline Period (as defined below) (the “Post Closing Secondary Margin”), less (y) the amount by which the Contribution Margin from sales by the Business to BofA and the Other Existing Partners, collectively, for the twelve-month period immediately following the Baseline Period decreases compared to, for the Baseline Period, the actual Contribution Margin from sales by the Business to the Other Existing Partners plus the agreed normalized Contribution Margin for BofA (the “Pre-Closing Primary Margin Decrease”); provided, however, that if the Pre-Closing Primary Margin Decrease exceeds the Post Closing Secondary Margin, no Earn-Out Payment shall be due.  The actual Contribution Margin from sales by the Business to the Other Existing Partners for the eleven-month period ended July 31, 2014 and the agreed normalized Contribution Margin for BofA are set forth on Schedule 1.7(a)(ii). Within 10 business days after the Closing Date, Seller shall provide the actual Contribution Margin from sales by the Business to the Other Existing Partners for the twelve months ended immediately prior to the month in which the Closing occurs (such period, the "Baseline Period"), which shall reflect the actual Contribution Margin amounts set forth on Schedule 1.7(a)(ii).  “Contribution Margin” means, with respect to a Person, revenues of such Person (calculated in accordance with GAAP) in respect of goods and services of the nature provided by the Business in the twelve-month period immediately preceding the Closing, minus cost of such revenues of such Person (calculated in accordance with GAAP), minus the operating expenses of such Person as set forth on Schedule 1.7(a)(ii), calculated in accordance with Schedule 1.7(a)(ii). For the avoidance of doubt, as used in the immediately preceding sentence, “goods and services of the nature provided by the Business” shall not extend to categories of rewards not offered by the Company to any of its partners as of the date hereof regardless of whether offered under a loyalty program and/or point redemption model, including travel rewards.
 
       (b) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event, no later than the date which is 60 days after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller (the “Earn-Out Calculation Statement”) a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail its determination of the Contribution Margin Calculation, and its calculation of the resulting Earn-Out Payment (the “Earn-Out Calculation”).

 
-6-

 
        
       (c) During the Earn-Out Review Period (defined below), Seller and its accountants and other representatives shall have the right to inspect the Company’s books and records during normal business hours at the Company’s offices, upon reasonable prior notice and solely for purposes reasonably related to the determinations of the Contribution Margin Calculation and the resulting Earn-Out Payment; provided, however, that (i) such access or inspection does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Company and (ii) neither Purchaser nor the Company is under any obligation to disclose to Seller any information the disclosure of which is prohibited by applicable Law or that would result in the waiver of any attorney-client, work-product or other applicable privilege.
 
       (d) After receipt of the Earn-Out Calculation Statement from Purchaser, Seller shall have 30 days to review the Earn-Out Calculation Statement and the Earn-Out Calculation set forth therein (the “Earn-Out Review Period”). The Earn-Out Calculation Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon, and deemed accepted by, Seller unless Seller shall have notified Purchaser in writing prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Review Period of any dispute or objection thereto (any such written dispute or objection, the “Earn-Out Objection”), setting forth the items in the Earn-Out Calculation disputed by Seller and describing in reasonable detail the basis for such objection, as well as the amount in dispute. Seller and Purchaser shall, within ten days (or such longer period as Seller and Purchaser may agree in writing) following delivery of an Earn-Out Objection to Purchaser (the “Earn-Out Resolution Period”), attempt in good faith to resolve the disputed items and agree upon the resulting amount of the Contribution Margin Calculation and the resulting Earn-Out Payment. All such discussions and communications related thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, and any resolution by them agreed to in writing as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.
 
       (e) If at the end of the Earn-Out Resolution Period Seller and Purchaser have been unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Earn-Out Objection, all unresolved disputed items shall be promptly referred to the CPA Firm for resolution. The CPA Firm shall be directed to render a written report on the unresolved disputed items with respect to the Earn-Out Calculation as promptly as practicable, but in no event greater than thirty (30) days after such submission to the CPA Firm, and to resolve only those unresolved disputed items set forth in the Earn-Out Objection. If unresolved disputed items are submitted to the CPA Firm, Purchaser and Seller shall each furnish to the CPA Firm such work papers, schedules and other documents and information relating to the unresolved disputed items as the CPA Firm may reasonably request. The CPA Firm shall resolve the disputed items based solely on the applicable definitions and other terms in this Agreement and the presentations by Purchaser and Seller, and not by independent review. The resolution of the dispute and the calculation of the Contribution Margin Calculation that is the subject of the applicable Earn-Out Objection by the CPA Firm shall be final and binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in proportion to the amounts by which their respective calculations of the Contribution Margin Calculation differ from the Contribution Margin Calculation as finally determined by the CPA Firm.
 
       (f) The Earn-Out Payment shall be paid in full no later than five (5) days following the date upon which the determination of the Contribution Margin Calculation becomes final and binding upon the Parties as provided in Sections 1.7(d) and (e) (including any final resolution of any dispute raised by Seller in an Earn-Out Objection). Purchaser shall pay to Seller the applicable Earn-Out Payment in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
 
       (g) For the avoidance of doubt, during the twelve-month period immediately following the Closing, Purchaser shall have full and absolute discretion to operate the Company as it sees fit, provided, however, that Purchaser shall not take actions or omit to take actions for the primary purpose or primary effect of adversely impacting the Contribution Margin Calculation.

For the avoidance of doubt, Transaction Taxes do not include income Taxes. Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax Authority as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transaction Tax that could be imposed.

　　　　　　　　　　(iii) Seller shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(d) unless notice has been provided in accordance with Section 8.6(a) on or prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, and Seller shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(f) or Section 8.3(g) unless notice has been provided in accordance with Section 8.6(a) on or prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(iv) Except in respect of breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations or the Visa Return Losses, no Losses may be claimed by any Purchaser Indemnified Party until the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have first suffered aggregate Losses in excess of $240,000 (the “Basket”) (at which point the Seller will be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for all such Losses from the first dollar of Loss incurred);
 
　　　　　　　　　　(v) Except in respect of breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations or the Visa Return Losses, no Losses may be claimed by any Purchaser Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by Seller or shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses for purposes of this Section 8.4, other than Losses in excess of $24,000 (the “Minimum Loss Amount”) resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or circumstances;

　　　　　　　　　　(vi) no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification, to sue for damages or to assert any other right or remedy under this Agreement (whether under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise) against Seller or any of Seller’s Affiliates with respect to any Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent it is primarily a possible or potential Loss, cause of action or claim that such party believes may be asserted rather than a Loss, cause of action or claim that has, in fact, been filed of record against such party or one of its Affiliates or paid or incurred by such party or one of its Affiliates;
 
　　　　　　　　　　(vii) no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any amount relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent such Indemnified Party (or other Purchaser Indemnified Parties in the event of a Purchaser Indemnified Party, or other Seller Indemnified Parties in the event of a Seller Indemnified Party) has already recovered such amount with respect to such matter pursuant to that or other provisions of this Agreement; and
 
　　　　　　　　　　(viii) notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, an Indemnified Party  (as defined below) will not be entitled to recover, and no party shall be liable for, any incidental, consequential, exemplary, special, punitive or treble damages (except such items as an Indemnified Party may be required to pay to a third party as a result of any Third Party Claims (as defined below) subject to indemnification hereunder), and in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to any recovery under a “multiple of profits,” “multiple of cash flow”, “multiple of EBITDA” or similar valuation methodology in calculating the amount of any indemnifiable Losses.
 
       (b) Except as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.5(a), each party shall take, and shall cause its Affiliates to take, all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any of its Losses (including incurring costs to the extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the Losses) upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.
 
       (c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, following the Closing, its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than claims arising from fraud, criminal activity or willful misconduct on the part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VIII.
 
8.5  Computation of Indemnity Payments 
       (a) The amount payable under this ARTICLE VIII in respect of any Loss shall be calculated (i) net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts under indemnification agreements with third parties actually received by the Indemnified Party on account thereof; provided, in each case, that the determination whether to pursue such insurance recoveries shall be in the reasonable discretion of the Indemnified Parties; and (ii) net of any Tax benefits actually realized by the Indemnified Party on account thereof.
 
       (b) In the event that an insurance or third-party indemnification recovery is made or Tax benefits actually realized at any time after an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party has been made with respect to any indemnified Loss or indemnified Tax, then, to the extent of the amount of such indemnification payment, a refund equal to the aggregate net amount of the recovery or realized Tax benefit (less the costs of recovery to the Indemnified Party) shall be made promptly to the applicable Indemnifying Party.  The party making any indemnification payment hereunder shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party in respect of any Losses or Taxes indemnified by such party.
 
 
-44-

 
 
8.6  Procedures for Indemnification 
       (a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 (an “Indemnified Party”) shall notify the party against whom indemnification is sought (an “Indemnifying Party”) of the claim in writing (such written notice, an “Indemnification Notice”) promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, demand or other claim against the Indemnified Party by a third party (a “Third Party Claim”).  Each such Indemnification Notice shall describe, in reasonable detail to the extent practicable, the applicable Third Party Claim, including the facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided, that, the failure to so notify an Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.
 
       (b) Any Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party’s expense, and, at its option if exercised within ten Business Days after receiving an Indemnification Notice, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided, that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose (provided, that, the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party and shall not be recoverable from such Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE VIII).  If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim it will  be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnified Party shall have determined in good faith and upon advice of counsel that an actual or likely conflict of interest makes representation of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel inappropriate, or if the Indemnifying Party, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, has failed to diligently pursue the relevant claims or defense, then the Indemnified Party may, upon notice to the Indemnifying Party, engage separate counsel, and the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party to the extent the Third Party Claim is indemnifiable hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.6(b), the Indemnified Party will have the absolute right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (the reasonable fees and expenses of which shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party, subject to the limitations set forth in this ARTICLE VIII), the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal or quasi criminal Proceeding; (iii) the amount of Losses involved in such Third Party Claim exceeds the then-remaining amount available for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(i) or (ii), or (iv) the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume control of the defense within ten Business Days after receiving an Indemnification Notice.
 
       (c) Upon assumption of the defense of any such Third Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party will not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of the Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle, or admit any Liability with respect to, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the relief consists solely of (i) money damages (all of which the Indemnifying Party shall pay) and (ii) includes a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified Party from all Liability with respect thereto.
 
       (d) In all cases, the Indemnified Party shall provide its reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in defense of claims or litigation relating to Third Party Claims, including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably available.  If the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, or fails to prosecute or withdraws from the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may defend against such matter in a manner consistent with the above provisions regarding conduct of the defense by the Indemnified Party; provided, that, the Indemnified Party may not settle any such matter without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
 
 
-45-

 
 
       (e) Any Indemnified Party making a claim against any Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request; provided, however, the failure to so notify an Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.
 
8.7  Timing and Method of Payments 
       (a) Subject to this ARTICLE VIII, after any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Authority with competent jurisdiction (and a resolution of any appeal therefrom and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom), or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case, with respect to an indemnification claim hereunder: (i) if the Indemnified Party is a Purchaser Indemnified Party, Purchaser and Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to promptly pay to Purchaser (payable by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. funds in accordance with the written payment instructions furnished by Purchaser to the Escrow Agent), from the Indemnity Escrow Funds, any sums due and owing in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII, and Seller shall pay directly any amounts payable to the Purchaser Indemnified Party in excess of the remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds, if any, and (ii) if the Indemnified Party is a Seller Indemnified Party, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, all sums due and owing to Seller Indemnified Party in immediately available funds to an account specified by Seller Indemnified Party (subject in all instances to clauses (i) and (ii) above, and to the limitations in Section 8.4), in each case, within five Business Days of such final decision, judgment or award, or other settlement or agreement.
 
       (b) Any remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds shall be released to Seller on the next day after the first anniversary of the Closing, net of any outstanding, unresolved claims in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII. Any Indemnity Escrow Funds not (x) disbursed the next day after the first anniversary of the Closing on account of unresolved claims by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties against Sellers, or (y) subsequently disbursed in respect of such claims shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to Seller promptly following the final resolution, in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII, of the last unresolved indemnification claim for which notice was provided to Seller hereunder on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing.
 
       (c) In the event Seller fails to pay any amounts owed pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII within the time period required hereby (including by refusing to cooperate in causing the Escrow Agent to release any Indemnity Escrow Funds), Purchaser may set off the amount owed against the Earn-out Payment.
 
8.8  Characterization of Indemnification Payments; Withholding 
       (a) Unless otherwise required by Law, all payments made pursuant to ARTICLE VIII hereof shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price.
 
       (b) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign law relating to any Tax. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority by Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 
-46-

 
8.9  Special Provisions regarding BAML Receivable Indemnification 
       To the extent of any indemnity amount paid to Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.3(j) hereof relating to the nonpayment of the BAML Receivable, Purchaser shall cause the Company to assign to Seller the BAML Receivable.  Following any such assignment, Seller shall be entitled to enforce the BAML Receivable against BAML and any appropriate Affiliate thereof for Seller's account.  In the event of any such enforcement action, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, at Seller's expense, reasonably cooperate with Seller in such enforcement, including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably available and, if necessary, by consenting to being named as a nominal party plaintiff in any enforcement litigation.

       (a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;
 
       (b) by Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller and the Company, if Seller or the Company breaches or fails to perform, in any respect, any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3, (ii) cannot be, or has not been, cured within 10 days following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform and (iii) has not been waived by Purchaser;
 
       (c) by Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser, if Purchaser breaches or fails to perform, in any respect, any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, (ii) cannot be, or has not been, cured within 10 days following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform and (iii) has not been waived by Seller; and
 
       (d) by Purchaser or by Seller, upon written notice to the other party, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the Outside Date; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to a party if the failure of such party to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement is the primary cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date.

10.3  Severability 
       It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.  Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.
 
10.4  Enforcement 
       The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate New York State or federal court), this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity.  Each of the parties hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

10.5  Entire Agreement 
       This Agreement, the Related Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto) contain the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter.  Neither party shall be liable or bound to any other party in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to such subject matter except as specifically set forth herein or in the Related Documents or the Confidentiality Agreement.
 
10.6  Assignment 
       This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Purchaser, Seller or the Company (including by operation of law in connection with a merger or consolidation of Purchaser) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that Seller may assign any or all of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement, including the right to receive the Purchase Price or any portion of the Closing Payment, to one or more Affiliates of Seller without the consent of Purchaser, but no such assignment will limit Seller’s obligations hereunder.  Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 10.6 shall be null and void.
 
10.7  No Third-Party Beneficiaries 
       Except as set forth in Section 4.6, Section 10.12 and ARTICLE VIII, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing in this Agreement expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and such successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights under this Agreement.

10.9  Waiver 
       No failure or delay of either party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.  Any agreement on the part of either party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party.
 
10.10  Governing Law; Jurisdiction 
       (a) This Agreement and all disputes, claims or controversies relating to, arising out of, or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of New York without regard to the Laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied because of the conflicts of laws rules of the State of New York.

10.11  Waiver of Jury Trial 
       EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
