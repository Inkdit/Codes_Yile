The Company shall, and shall cause its direct or indirect subsidiaries to, use its best efforts to ensure that the Company and its direct or indirect subsidiaries arrange their affairs, including taking such restructuring steps as may be necessary, to implement the most tax-advantageous structure for the Company, its direct or indirect United States based shareholders (including without limitation the United States based Purchasers and their direct or indirect investors), subsidiaries and prospective investors who may acquire shares of the Company in the IPO, including, without limitation, to ensure that the Company will not be treated or classified as a "passive foreign investment company" ("PFIC") as defined in Section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, U.S.A., as amended (the "Code"), for the current or any future taxable year. The Company shall not, and shall cause its direct or indirect subsidiaries not to, take any action or steps that would result in the occurrence of any adverse tax impact on any United States based Purchaser. Upon a determination by the Company, any United States based Purchaser (or any direct or indirect investor in a United States based Purchaser) or any taxing authority that the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary has been or is likely to become a PFIC as defined in the Code for a taxable year, the Company will promptly notify each United States based Purchaser of such determination and will provide as soon as practicable (but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the end of such taxable year) any United States based Purchaser with all information reasonably available to the Company or any of its subsidiaries to permit such United States based Purchaser (and its direct or indirect investors, as applicable) to (a) accurately prepare all tax returns and comply with any reporting requirements as a result of such determination, (b) make any election (including, without limitation, a "qualified electing fund" election ("QEF Election") under Section 1295 of the Code), with respect to the Company and/or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, and comply with any reporting or other requirements incident to such election, (c) file a "protective statement" pursuant to Section 1295 of the Code with respect to the Company and/or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, and comply with any reporting or other requirements incident to such statement. Upon request from a United States based Purchaser, the Company shall, and shall cause its direct and indirect subsidiaries to, provide such United States based Purchaser (for the benefit of such United States based Purchaser's direct or indirect investors, as applicable) with accurately completed "PFIC Annual Information Statements", substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, as required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1295-1(g) and otherwise comply with applicable Treasury Regulation requirements, or "Annual Intermediary Statements", as requested by the United States based Purchaser. The Company will promptly notify the United States based Purchasers of any assertion by the Internal Revenue Service that the Company or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries is, or is likely to become, a PFIC. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent of its available cash and to the extent allowable by law, pay the shareholders of the Company a dividend sufficient to enable any United States based Purchasers (or their equity holders) who have made a QEF Election to defray their U.S. federal income tax liabilities arising from such QEF Election.

　　Should the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary be determined to be a PFIC, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent of its available cash and to the extent allowable by law, pay the Purchasers a dividend sufficient to defray their additional U.S. federal tax liabilities arising from such determination.
　　1.9 Controlled Foreign Corporation. The Company will provide prompt written notice to the United States based Purchasers if at any time the Company becomes aware that it or any direct or indirect subsidiary has become a "controlled foreign corporation" (as defined in the Code) ("CFC"). Upon request of a United States based Purchaser from time to time, subject to obtaining the consent of its shareholders to release such information, the Company will promptly provide in writing such information in its possession concerning its shareholders and, to the Company's actual knowledge, the direct and indirect interest holders in each shareholder reasonably sufficient for such United States based Purchaser to determine whether the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary is a CFC. The Company shall provide United States based Purchasers with reasonable access to such other Company information as the Company may then have available to it as may reasonably be required by any United States based Purchaser (or its direct or indirect investors, as applicable) to determine the Company's status as a CFC to determine whether such United States based Purchaser (or its direct or indirect investor) is required to report its pro rata portion of the Company's "Subpart F income" (as defined in the Code) on its United States federal income tax return, or to allow such United States based Purchaser to otherwise comply with applicable United States federal income tax law. The parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any future issuance of securities by the Company to the extent that such issuance would result in such shareholder or any direct or indirect investor in such shareholder being considered a "United States shareholder" of the Company within the meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code (a "United States Shareholder"). Without limiting the Company's obligations as set forth in this Section 1.9, for the avoidance of doubt, neither the Company nor the Ordinary Shareholders (or the Founders) are responsible for any tax filings of the United States based Purchasers or for any associated or related costs incurred in connection with such tax filings.

The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each direct or indirect subsidiary of, or entity controlled by, the Company, including without limitation the PRC Companies, whether now in existence or formed in the future, to comply in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

If any Holder disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, such Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the underwriter(s), delivered at least ten (10) business days prior to the effective date of the registration statement. Any Registrable Securities and/or other securities so excluded or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to this Section 2.5 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered, unless the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities then outstanding agree that such registration constitutes the use by the Holders of one (1) demand registration pursuant to this Section 2.5 (in which case such registration shall also constitute the use by all Holders of Registrable Securities of one (l) such demand registration); provided further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the Holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of the Company not known to the Holders at the time of their request for such registration and have withdrawn their request for registration with reasonable promptness after learning of such material adverse change, then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and such registration shall not constitute the use of a demand registration pursuant to this Section 2.5.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such offering is the Qualified IPO, any or all of the Registrable Securities of the Holders may be excluded in accordance with this Section 2.6(b), provided that any and all securities of the Company to be sold by other selling shareholders are also excluded.

　　If the Company fails to perform any of the Company's obligations set forth above in this Section 2.8 relating to a demand registration made pursuant to Section 2.5, such registration shall not constitute the use of a demand registration under Section 2.5.

　　2.10 Indemnification. In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under Sections 2.5, 2.6 or 2.7.
         (a) By the Company. To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its partners, officers, directors, trustees, legal counsel and any underwriter (as determined in the Securities Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act against any expenses, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) (or actions in respect thereof) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law or other applicable law, insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, a "Violation"):
　　　　　　　(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, offering circular, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or other document, or any amendments or supplements thereto;
　　　　　　　(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; or
　　　　　　　(iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any federal or state or foreign securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other applicable securities law in connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and the Company will reimburse each such Holder, its partner, officer, director, legal counsel, underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them, as incurred, in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section2.10(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by such Holder, underwriter or controlling person of such Holder.
 
25



         (b) By Selling Holders. To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, any underwriter (as determined in the Securities Act) and any other Holder selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other Holder's partners, directors, officers, trustees, legal counsel and any underwriter (as determined in the Securities Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who controls other Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) (or actions in respect thereof) to which the Company or any such director, officer, trustee, legal counsel, controlling person, underwriter or such other Holder, partner or director, officer or controlling person of such other Holder may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other applicable law, insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, officer, controlling person, underwriter or other Holder, partner, officer, director or controlling person of such other Holder in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action: provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.10(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further that the total amounts payable in indemnity by a Holder under this Section 2.10(b) plus any amount under Section 2.10(e) in respect of any Violation shall not exceed the net proceeds received by such Holder in the registered offering out of which such Violation arises.
         (c) Notice. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.10 of notice of the commencement of any claim or action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.10, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof (a "Claim Notice") and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonable fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, (i) during the period from the delivery of a Claim Notice until retention of counsel by the indemnifying party; and (ii) if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflict of interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver a Claim Notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time shall relieve such indemnifying party of liability to the indemnified party under this Section 2.10 to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result thereof, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnified party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.10.
 
26



         (d) Defect Eliminated in Final Prospectus. The foregoing indemnity agreements of the Company and Holders are subject to the condition that, insofar as they relate to any untrue statement, alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission made in a preliminary prospectus or free writing prospectus on file with the Commission at the time the registration statement becomes effective, such indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any person if an amended prospectus is filed with the Commission and delivered pursuant to the Securities Act at or prior to the time of sale (including, without limitation, a contract of sale, and as further contemplated by Rule 159 promulgated under the Securities Act) to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage.
         (e) Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any Holder exercising rights under this Agreement, or any controlling person of any such Holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.10 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that this Section 2.10 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such selling Holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 2.10; then, and in each such case, the Company and such Holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion so that such Holder is responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the public offering price of its Registrable Securities offered by and sold under the registration statement bears to the public offering price of all securities offered by and sold under such registration statement, and the Company and other selling Holders are responsible for the remaining portion; provided, however, that, in any such case: (A) no such Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such registration statement; and (B) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
         (f) Supremacy of the Underwriting Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control.
         (g) Survival. The obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.10 shall survive until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement, regardless of the expiration of any statutes of limitation or extensions of such statutes.

         (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of the first registration filed by the Company for an offering of its securities to the general public;
         (b) take such action, including the voluntary registration of its Ordinary Shares under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, as is necessary to enable the Holders to utilize Form S-3 or Form F-3 for the sale of their Registrable Securities, such action to be taken as soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal year in which the first registration statement filed by the Company for the offering of its securities to the general public is declared effective;
         (c) file with the Commission, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, at all times after the effective date of the first registration under the Securities Act filed by the Company; and

　　2.13 No Registration Rights to Third Parties. Without the prior written consent of the Holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the Registrable Securities then outstanding, the Company covenants and agrees that it shall not grant, or cause or permit to be created, for the benefit of any person or entity any registration rights of any kind (whether similar to the demand, "piggyback" or Form S-3/F-3 registration rights described in this Section 2, or otherwise) relating to any shares or other securities of the Company, other than rights that are subordinate to the rights of the Holders hereunder.

　　2.14 "Market Stand-Off" Agreement.

　　The obligations of each Holder under this Section 2.14 are subject to the following conditions: (a) the lock-up or standoff agreement applies only to the first registration statement of the Company which covers securities to be sold on its behalf to the public in an underwritten offering, but not to Registrable Securities actually sold pursuant to such registration statement; (b) such Holder is reasonably satisfied that all directors, officers, and holders of one half percent (0.5%) or more of any class of securities of the Company are bound by substantially identical restrictions; (c) the lock-up or standoff agreement provides that if any securities of the Company are to be excluded or released in whole or part from such restrictions, the underwriter shall so notify each Holder and each Holder shall be excluded or released, in proportionate amounts to the extent of the exclusion or release with respect to any other holder of Company's securities, including director, officer, or holder of one percent (1%) or more of any class of securities of the Company subject to such restrictions; and (d) the lock-up or standoff agreement by its terms permits transfers of Registrable Securities by any Holder to any Affiliate of such Holder during the restricted period, provided that such Affiliate executes a lock-up or standoff agreement substantively identical to that signed by the transferring Holder.
　　The Company may impose a stop-transfer instruction with respect to Registrable Securities subject to any such lock-up or standoff agreement but shall remove such instruction immediately upon expiration of the underlying restrictions.
　　2.15 Public Offering Rights (Non-U.S. Offerings). If shares of the Company are offered in an underwritten public offering (whether or not a Qualified IPO) outside the United States for the account of any Ordinary Shareholder or other shareholders, each Holder shall have the right to include a pro-rata number of shares (based on the number of shares (on an as converted basis) then held by such holder and all other shareholders of the Company selling in the offering) in the offering on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Holders than to any other selling shareholder.
　　2.16 Re-sale Rights. The Company shall use its best efforts to assist each Holder in the sale or disposition of its Registrable Securities after a Qualified IPO, including the prompt delivery of applicable instruction letters by the Company and legal opinions from the Company's counsel in forms reasonably satisfactory to the Holder's counsel. In the event the Company has depositary receipts listed or traded on any stock exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, the Company shall pay all costs and fees related to such depositary facility, including conversion fees and maintenance fees for Registrable Securities held by the Holders.
　　2.17 Transfer of Registration Rights. The rights to cause the Company to register securities granted to any Holder under this Section 2 may be assigned to a transferee or assignee in connection with any transfer or assignment of Registrable Securities by the Holder, provided that, (a) such transfer may otherwise be effected in accordance with applicable securities laws, (b) the Company is given notice of the transfer, and (c) such assignee or transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

3.Right of First Offer.　　3.1 Right of First Offer of Company Offerings. Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Section 3.1, the Company hereby grants to each Purchaser a right of first offer to purchase its Pro Rata Share (as hereinafter defined) (in whole or in part) with respect to future sales by the Company of New Securities (as hereinafter defined).
　　For purposes of this Section 3.1, a Purchaser's "Pro Rata Share" shall mean that number of New Securities that equals the total number of such New Securities to be sold by the Company, multiplied by the ratio that (i) the number of Ordinary Share Equivalents held by such Purchaser bears to (ii) the total number of Ordinary Share Equivalents of the Company outstanding (assuming full conversion of all Preferred Shares then outstanding and the exercise of all option then outstanding under the Company's employee stock ownership plans) immediately prior to the issuance of New Securities giving rise to the Right of First Offer. "Ordinary Share Equivalents" shall mean the number of issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares, and Ordinary Shares into which the issued and outstanding Preferred Shares and other convertible securities are convertible.
　　Subject to Section 3.1(d), each time the Company proposes to offer any shares of, or securities convertible into or exercisable for any shares of, any class of its shares (the "New Securities"), the Company shall first make an offering of such New Securities to each Purchaser in accordance with the following provisions:
         (a) The Company shall deliver a written notice (the "Notice") pursuant to Section 6.7 hereof to each of the Purchasers stating (i) its bona fide intention to offer such New Securities, (ii) the number of such New Securities to be offered, and (iii) the price and a summary of the terms, if any, upon which it proposes to offer such New Securities.
         (b) (i) By written notification received by the Company within fifteen (15) business days after delivery of the Notice (the "Refusal Period"), each Purchaser may elect to purchase or obtain, at the price and on the terms specified in the Notice, up to its Pro Rata Share of such New Securities.
　　　　　　　(ii) In the event that any Purchaser elects not to purchase its full Pro Rata Share of the New Securities available to it pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) above within the Refusal Period, then the Company shall promptly give written notice (the "Overallotment Notice") to each of the Purchasers that has elected to purchase its full Pro Rata Share (the "Fully Participating Purchasers"), which notice shall set forth the number of New Securities not purchased by the other Purchasers pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) (such shares, the "Overallotment New Securities"), and shall offer the Fully Participating Purchasers the right to purchase its pro rata share of the Overallotment New Securities. By written notification received by the Company within five (5) business days after delivery of the Overallotment Notice, each Fully Participating Purchaser may elect to purchase or obtain at the price and terms specified in the Notice, up to its pro rata share of the Overallotment New Securities. For purposes of this Section 3.1(b)(ii), each Fully Participating Purchaser's pro rata share shall be the number of Overallotment New Securities multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Ordinary Share Equivalents held by such Fully Participating Purchaser on the date of the Notice and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Ordinary Share Equivalents held by all Fully Participating Purchasers on the date of the Notice.
 
30
