　　2. Registration Rights
　　The Company covenants and agrees as follows:
　　　　　　　2.1. Request for Registration.
         (a) If the Company shall receive at any time after the earlier of (i) three years after the date of this Agreement or (ii) 180 days after the effective date of the first registration statement for a public offering of securities of the Company (other than a registration statement relating either to the sale of securities to employees of the Company pursuant to a stock option, stock purchase or similar plan or a SEC Rule 145 transaction), a written request from the Requisite Investors that the Company file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the registration of the Registrable Securities then outstanding having an anticipated aggregate offering price, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of at least $5,000,000, then the Company shall:
                   (i) within ten (10) days of the receipt thereof, give written notice of such request to all Holders;
                   (ii) as soon as practicable, and in any event within 60 days of the receipt of such request, file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering all Registrable Securities which the Holders request to be registered, subject to the limitations of subsection 2.1(b); and
                   (iii) use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable.
         (b) If the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant tosubsection 2.1(a) and the Company shall include such information in the written notice referred to insubsection 2.1(a). The underwriter will be selected by the Initiating Holders, subject to the reasonable approval of the Company. In such event, the right of any Holder to include such Holder's Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder's participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting shall (together with the
 
-5-

Company as provided in subsection 2.3(e)) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.1, if the underwriter advises the Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the Initiating Holders shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of shares of Registrable Securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among all Holders of Registrable Securities, including the Initiating Holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number of Registrable Securities of the Company owned by each Holder;provided, however, that (i) the number of shares of Registrable Securities held by the Holders to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities are first entirely excluded from the underwriting and (ii) the number of shares of Registrable Securities held by the Investors to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all Registrable Securities held by Maven are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. To facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above provisions, the Company or the underwriters may round the number of shares allocated to any Holder to the nearest 100 shares.
         (c) The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration
　　　　　　　(i) pursuant to this Section 2.1:
                   (A) In any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required under the Securities Act;
                   (B) After the Company has effected two registrations pursuant to this Section 2.1 and such registrations have been declared or ordered effective;
                   (C) If the Initiating Holders propose to dispose of shares of Registrable Securities that may be immediately registered on Form S-3 pursuant to a request made pursuant to Section 2.11 below; or
                   (D) If the Registrable Securities to be included in the registration statement could be sold without restriction under SEC Rule 144(k) within a ninety (90) day period and the Company is currently subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Sections 12(g) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or
　　　　　　　(ii) pursuant to any other provision of this Agreement:
                   (A) In any particular jurisdiction in which the Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process in effecting such registration, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required under the Securities Act; or
                   (B) If the Registrable Securities to be included in the registration statement could be sold without restriction under SEC Rule 144(k) within a ninety (90) day period and the Company is currently subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Sections 12(g) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
 
-6-

         (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company shall furnish to Holders requesting a registration statement pursuant to this Section 2.1 a certificate signed by the President of the Company stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to become effective or to remain effective as long as such registration statement would otherwise be required to remain effective because such action (x) would materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate reorganization or other similar transaction involving the Company, (y) would require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) would render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, the Company shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to such filing for a period of not more than ninety (90) days after receipt of the request of the Initiating Holders; provided, however, that the Company may not utilize this right (or any similar right granted to the Company pursuant to Section 2.11(b)) more than twice in any twelve-month period and provided furtherthat the Company shall not register any securities for the account of itself or any other stockholder during such ninety (90) day period other than a registration statement relating either to the sale of securities to employees of the Company pursuant to a stock option, stock purchase or similar plan or an SEC Rule 145 transaction, a registration on any form that does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the Registrable Securities, or a registration in which the only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being registered.
         (e) For purposes of Section 2.1(c)(i), a registration statement shall not be counted until such time as such registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC (unless the Initiating Holders withdraw their request for such registration (other than as a result of information concerning the business or financial condition of the Company which is made known to the Investors after the date on which such registration was requested) and elect not to pay the registration expenses therefor pursuant to Section 2.5). A registration statement shall not be counted if, as a result of an exercise of the underwriter's cut-back provisions, fewer than 50% of the total number of Registrable Securities that Holders have requested to be included in such registration statement are actually included.
　　　　　　　2.2. Company Registration.
         If the Company proposes to register (including for this purpose the IPO and a registration effected by the Company for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its stock or other securities under the Securities Act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than a registration statement relating either to the sale of securities to employees of the Company pursuant to a stock option, stock purchase or similar plan or an SEC Rule 145 transaction, a registration on any form which does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of the Registrable Securities or a registration in which the only Common Stock being registered is Common Stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities which are also being registered), the Company shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder written notice of such registration.
 
-7-

Upon the written request of each Holder given within twenty (20) days after mailing of such notice by the Company in accordance with Section 6.5, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of Section 2.7, cause to be registered under the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be registered. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this Section 2.2 prior to the effectiveness of such registration whether or not any Holder has elected to include securities in such registration. The expenses of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with Section 2.6 hereof.
　　　　　　　2.3. Obligations of the Company.
         Whenever required under this Section 2 to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:
         (a) prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities registered thereunder, keep such registration statement effective for a period of up to one hundred twenty (120) days or, if earlier, until the distribution contemplated in the Registration Statement has been completed; provided, however, that such 120-day period shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period the Holder refrains from selling any securities included in such registration at the request of an underwriter of Common Stock (or other securities) of the Company;
         (b) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement;
         (c) furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registrable Securities owned by them;
         (d) use its reasonable best efforts to register and qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Holders; provided that the Company shall not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any such states or jurisdictions, unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act;
         (e) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter of such offering. Each Holder participating in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its obligations under such an agreement;

         (f) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this Agreement hereunder to be listed on a national securities exchange and each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;
         (g) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities registered pursuant hereunder and a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not later than the effective date of such registration;
         (h) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish, at the request of any Holder requesting registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2, on the date on which such Registrable Securities are sold to the underwriter, (i) an opinion, dated such date, of the counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and (ii) a "comfort" letter dated such date, from the independent certified public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any.
         (i) after such registration statement becomes effective, notify each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement of any amendment or supplement of such registration statement or prospectus.
　　　　　　　2.4. Furnish Information.
         It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to thisSection 2 with respect to the Registrable Securities of any selling Holder that such Holder shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such Holder's Registrable Securities.
　　　　　　　2.5. Expenses of Demand Registration.
         All expenses other than underwriting discounts and commissions incurred in connection with registrations, filings or qualifications pursuant to Section 2.1, including (without limitation) all registration, filing and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and the reasonable fees of one counsel for the selling Holders shall be borne by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 2.1 if the registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities to be registered (in which case all participating Holders shall bear such expenses pro rata based upon the number of Registrable Securities that were to be included in the withdrawn registration), unless the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities agree to forfeit their right to one demand registration pursuant to Section 2.1; provided further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the Holders have learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of the Company from that known to the Holders at the time of their request and have withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness after learning of such information, then the Holders shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights pursuant to Section 2.1.
 
-9-

　　　　　　　2.6. Expenses of Company Registration.
         The Company shall bear and pay all expenses incurred in connection with any registration, filing or qualification of Registrable Securities with respect to the registrations pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof for each Holder (which right may be assigned as provided in Section 2.12 hereof), including (without limitation) all registration, filing, and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees relating or apportionable thereto and the fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling Holders selected by them, but excluding underwriting discounts and commissions relating to Registrable Securities.
　　　　　　　2.7. Underwriting Requirements.
         In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant toSection 2.2, the Company shall not be required to include any of the Holders' securities in such underwriting unless they accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Company. If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the amount of securities to be sold other than by the Company that the underwriters determine in their reasonable discretion is compatible with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and the Company determine in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering. In no event shall any Registrable Securities held by Investors, Maven or the Founder be excluded from such offering unless all other stockholders' securities have been first excluded. Further, in no event shall any Registrable Securities held by Investors or Maven be excluded unless all Registrable Securities held by the Founder, if any, have been excluded. In the event that the underwriters determine that, following the cutbacks described in the preceding two sentences, less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered by Investors and Maven can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities held by Investors and Maven that are included in such offering shall be apportioned pro rata among the selling Investors and Maven (if Maven has elected to sell) based on the number of Registrable Securities held by all selling Investors and Maven (if Maven has elected to sell) or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Investors and Maven. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the amount of securities of the selling Investors included in the offering be reduced below thirty-three percent (33%) of the total amount of securities included in such offering, unless such offering is the Qualified Public Offering in which case the selling Investors may be excluded beyond this amount if the underwriters make the determination described above and no other stockholder's securities are included in such offering. For purposes of apportionment pursuant to thisSection 2.7, for any selling stockholder which is a Holder of Registrable Securities and which is an investment fund, partnership, limited liability company or corporation, the partners, members, retired partners, retired members, stockholders and Affiliates of such Holder, or the estates and family members of any such partners, retired partners, members and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of
 
-10-

the foregoing persons shall be deemed to be a single "selling Holder", and any pro-rata reduction with respect to such "selling Holder" shall be based upon the aggregate amount of shares carrying registration rights owned by all entities and individuals included in such "selling Holder," as defined in this sentence.
　　　　　　　2.8. Delay of Registration.
         No Holder shall have any right to obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any registration pursuant to this Agreement as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or implementation of this Section 2.
　　　　　　　2.9. Indemnification.
         In the event any Registrable Securities are included in a registration statement under this Section 2:
         (a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, the partners, members, officers, directors and stockholders of each Holder, legal counsel and accountants for each Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for such Holder and each person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Violation and the Company will pay to each such Holder, underwriter, controlling person or other aforementioned person, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in thissubsection 2.9(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any such Holder, underwriter, controlling person or other aforementioned person.
         (b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants for the Company, any underwriter, any other Holder selling securities in such registration statement and any controlling person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder will pay any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this subsection 2.9(b), in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however,
 
-11-

that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 2.9(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, further, that, in no event shall any indemnity under thissubsection 2.9(b) exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Holder, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct by such Holder.
         (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 2.9 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.9, deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties which may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party hereunder shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which it may have to the indemnified party other than under this Section 2.9 and shall only relieve it from any liability which it may have to such indemnified party under this Section 2.9 if and to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by such omission.
         (d) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (i) any Holder exercising rights under this Agreement, or any controlling person of any such Holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 2.9 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that thisSection 2.9 provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any such selling Holder or any such controlling person in circumstances for which indemnification is provided under this Section 2.9, then, and in each such case, the Company and such Holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission; provided, however, that, in any such case, (I) no such Holder will be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering price of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by such Holder pursuant to such registration statement,

and (II) no person or entity guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; provided further, that in no event shall a Holder's liability pursuant to this Section 2.9(d), when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such holder pursuant to Section 2.9(b), exceed the proceeds from the offering (net of any underwriting discounts or commissions) received by such Holder, except in the case of willful fraud by such Holder.
         (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control.
         (f) Unless otherwise superseded by an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering, the obligations of the Company and Holders under this Section 2.9 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration statement under this Section 2, and otherwise shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
　　　　　　　2.10. Reports Under Exchange Act.

         From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Requisite Investors, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Company which would allow such holder or prospective holder (a) to include such securities in any registration unless under the terms of such agreement, such holder or prospective holder may include such securities in any such registration only to the extent that the inclusion of such securities will not reduce the amount of the Registrable Securities of the Holders that are included or (b) to demand registration of any securities held by such holder or prospective holder.
