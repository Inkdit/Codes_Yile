　　Section 10. Indemnification.
　　(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Underwriter and the Issuer and any member, commissioner, officer, director, employee or agent of the Underwriter or the Issuer and each person, if any, who controls the Underwriter or the Issuer within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, or Section 20 of the 1934 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any and all losses, costs, claims, damages, liabilities, attorneys' fees or other expenses whatsoever (collectively, "Loss") which any of them may incur or suffer, without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on their part, arising out of, in connection with or relating to the issuance and sale of the Bonds and the determination by the Underwriter of the initial Interest Rate on the Series 2005A Bonds, including, without limitation, any Loss caused by, or which arises out of or relates to, any breach (or alleged breach) by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth herein, or any untrue statement or misleading statement of a material fact contained in the Official Statement or incorporated therein by reference (except, with respect to the Issuer, statements provided or approved by the Issuer and, with respect to the Underwriter, statements pertaining to the Bank or the Underwriter) or supplied by the Company in writing in connection with the issuance and sale of Series 2005A Bonds in accordance with the terms hereof and of the Remarketing Agreement (collectively, the "Disclosure Materials"), or which arises out of or relates to, any omission or alleged omission from such Disclosure Materials of any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (except omissions or alleged omissions pertaining to the respective Indemnified Party). This indemnity agreement is in addition to any other liability that the Company may otherwise have.
　　(b) In case any suit, action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be brought against one or more of the Indemnified Parties and in respect of which indemnity may be sought as provided herein, such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties shall promptly notify the Company in writing setting forth the particulars of such suit, action or proceeding and the Company shall promptly assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties, payment of all expenses and the right to negotiate and consent to settlement; but the omission to notify the Company as provided herein shall not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have (i) under this Section 10, so long as the Company is given the reasonable opportunity to defend such claim, and (ii) otherwise than under this Section 10. Any one or more of the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Company, (ii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties and representation of both the Company and such Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them, or (iii) the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties have been advised that one or more legal defenses may be available to any or all of them which may not be available to the Company in which case the Company shall not be entitled to assume the defense of such suit notwithstanding its obligation to bear the fees and expenses of such counsel. The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its consent, but if settled with such consent or if there is a final judgment in any such action with or without consent, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party or Indemnified Parties from and against any Loss by reason of such settlement or judgment.
　　(c) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in this Section 10 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Company or unenforceable against the Company on grounds of public policy or otherwise,
 
12

the Company and the Underwriter shall contribute severally to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) to which the Company and the Underwriter may be subject in such proportion so that the Underwriter is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the underwriting fee referred to in Section 4(a) hereof bears to the initial par amount of all of the Series 2005A Bonds and the Company is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act, shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Any party entitled to contribution shall, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this paragraph, notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission so to notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it or they may have hereunder or otherwise. The liabilities under this paragraph are in addition to any other liabilities that the parties may have.
　　(d) The obligations under this Section 10 shall remain operative and in force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Underwriter, and shall survive the issuance and the maturity of the Series 2005A Bonds and any termination of this Bond Purchase Agreement.

　　Section 16. Miscellaneous.
　　(a) Nothing herein shall be construed to make any party hereto an employee of any other or to establish any fiduciary relationship among the Issuer, the Company and the Underwriter.
　　(b) This Bond Purchase Agreement may be amended from time to time only by an instrument in writing executed by all the parties hereto.
　　(c) The headings contained herein are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Bond Purchase Agreement.
 
13

　　(d) If any one or more of the covenants, provisions or agreements contained in this Bond Purchase Agreement shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the invalidity of such covenants, provisions and agreements shall in no way affect the validity or effectiveness of the remainder of this Bond Purchase Agreement, and this Bond Purchase Agreement shall continue in full force to the fullest extent permitted by law.
　　(e) All of the representations, warranties and covenants made in this Bond Purchase Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, or (ii) delivery of and any payment for any Bonds hereunder.

　　(g) THE BONDS ARE NOT GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE ISSUER BUT ARE SPECIAL, LIMITED OBLIGATIONS PAYABLE SOLELY FROM BOND PROCEEDS, RENT PAID BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT AND OTHER REVENUES PLEDGED THERETO AND HELD BY THE TRUSTEE UNDER THE INDENTURE WHICH CONSTITUTE THE TRUST ESTATE AND, IN THE CASE OF THE SERIES 2005A BONDS, FROM MONIES DRAWN UNDER THE LETTER OF CREDIT. IT IS HEREBY EXPRESSLY MADE A CONDITION OF THIS BOND PURCHASE AGREEMENT THAT ANY COVENANTS OR REPRESENTATIONS HEREIN CONTAINED OR CONTAINED IN THE BONDS DO NOT AND SHALL NEVER CONSTITUTE OR GIVE RISE TO A PERSONAL OR PECUNIARY LIABILITY OR CHARGE AGAINST THE GENERAL CREDIT OR TAXING POWERS OF THE ISSUER, AND IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH OF ANY SUCH COVENANT OR REPRESENTATION, NO PERSONAL OR PECUNIARY LIABILITY OR CHARGE PAYABLE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE REVENUES (OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVED FROM THE LEASING OR SALE OF THE PROJECT) OF THE ISSUER SHALL ARISE THEREFROM. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION, HOWEVER, SHALL RELIEVE THE ISSUER FROM THE OBSERVANCE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SEVERAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS ON ITS PART HEREIN CONTAINED. THE ISSUER HAS NO TAXING AUTHORITY WITH RESPECT TO THE BONDS.
