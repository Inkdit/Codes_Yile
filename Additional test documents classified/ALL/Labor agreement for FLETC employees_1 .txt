Section A.

Section C.


       Employees shall have the right to select available work schedules by seniority in job assignments for which they are qualified.  Each employee shall be given his work schedule.


Section D.


       Except as otherwise provided in Section A of this Article, seniority shall be measured from the date of the employee’s initial hire at the base with the Company or a predecessor employer engaged in providing similar services at the base, provided there has been no break in seniority under Section E of this Article.


6




Section E.


       An employee shall lose his seniority upon his retirement, resignation or discharge for just cause.  An employee will be considered to have resigned if he:


(1)       fails to report to work on the day following expiration of an authorized leave of absence, unless failure to report is due to conditions recognized by the Company to be beyond the control of the employee and he reported such conditions as soon as possible;


(2)       is on lay-off for a period exceeding one (1) year;


(3)       is absent from work for two (2) consecutive work days without properly notifying the Company of the reason for absence even though the reason for such absence is beyond the control of the employee; or in any event, fails to report for work as scheduled without such reason;


(4)       fails, while on layoff, upon notice from the Company that work is available, to report to the Company for work as soon as practicable, but not later than seven (7) work days and provided that the employee notifies the Company within three (3) days of such notice that he will return to work within the seven (7) day period.

Section F.


       An employee who has occupied a position with the Company covered by this agreement and who accepts a position with the Company in a classification not covered by this agreement will continue to accrue seniority for nine (9) months, after which period he shall retain his accumulated seniority, provided he remains in the employ of the employer.


ARTICLE VII - DISCHARGE


       No employee shall be discharged without just cause, and all dismissals will be subject to the grievance procedure and arbitration clause.  All reprimands shall be in writing, with a copy given to the Shop Steward.  Each reprimand shall be cancelled after one (1) year.  Three (3) reprimands shall result in immediate dismissal.  Theft, intoxication on the job, failure to perform work as directed, illegal use of drugs and showing disrespect to management and government personnel, shall result in immediate dismissal, regardless of the number of prior reprimands.

ARTICLE XXIII - HOLIDAYS


Section A.


       Holidays, for which every employee will be compensated at the hourly base rate of pay, are set forth in the applicable local Addendum attached hereto. In computing the number of hours for which an employee is entitled to compensation, the proportion which the average number of hours worked by an employee during the preceding normal work week bears to forty (40) hours shall be applied to eight (8) hours to determine the number of paid hours said employee is entitled to receive. For example, if an employee worked thirty (30) hours during the normal work week preceding the holiday week, his holiday pay would be computed by 3/4 (30/40) of eight (8) hours and multiplying the resulting six (6) hours by his hourly base rate of pay.


Section B.


       Any work performed on a holiday will be paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay in addition to the holiday pay. If any of the named holidays fall on a non-working day, the employees shall either observe the holiday on the following working day or shall receive pay for their average number of hours normally worked in lieu of the observance above their normal compensation for work performed.


Section C.


       In the event that one of the holidays shall occur during the employee’s vacation, the employee will receive an additional day of paid vacation, unless the employee and the Company agree that he may receive pay in lieu thereof.


Section D.


       When the Company requires work on any shift on a holiday, the Company will first seek qualified volunteers for such work.  If there are not enough volunteers for such work, the Company will select qualified employees to protect the work to be performed in reverse seniority; however, if too many volunteer, the Company will select qualified employees to protect the work in order of seniority.


Section E.
