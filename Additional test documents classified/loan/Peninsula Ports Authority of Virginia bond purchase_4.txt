the Partnership and the Underwriter as follows:

         (i)  the  Official  Statement (except for  the  information  under  the
heading "Underwriting") does not, and the related Preliminary Official Statement
(except for the information under the heading "Underwriting") as of its date did
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact  necessary  to make  the  statements  made in  them,  in the  light  of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Parent Company and
Pittston each consents to the use by the  Underwriter of the Official  Statement
insofar as it

                                       3

<PAGE>

relates  to each of them in  connection  with the sale and  distribution  of the
Bonds and confirms that it has similarly consented to the use of the Preliminary
Official  Statement  for such purpose  before the  availability  of the Official
Statement.  Pittston and the Parent Company deem the Official  Statement "final"
within the meaning of Rule 15c2-12 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

         (ii) (1)This Agreement, the Parent Company Guaranty and the Undertaking
(the  "Parent  Company  Documents")  have been  duly  authorized,  executed  and
delivered by the Parent Company and, assuming the due  authorization,  execution
and  delivery  by  the  other  parties  hereto,  constitute  valid  and  binding
agreements  of the Parent  Company  enforceable  against  the Parent  Company in
accordance with their terms (subject to applicable  bankruptcy,  reorganization,

creditors'  rights  generally and to the  availability  of equitable  remedies),
except as rights to indemnity  under this Agreement may be limited by applicable
law,  including  federal and state  securities  laws.  (2) This  Agreement,  the
Throughput  Agreement and the Assignment  (the "Pittston  Documents")  have been
duly  authorized,  executed  and  delivered  by Pittston  and,  assuming the due
authorization,  execution and delivery by the other parties  hereto,  constitute
valid and binding  agreements of the Pittston  enforceable  against  Pittston in
accordance with their terms (subject to applicable  bankruptcy,  reorganization,
insolvency,  moratorium  or other  similar laws  affecting  the  enforcement  of
creditors'  rights  generally and to the  availability  of equitable  remedies),
except as rights to indemnity  under this Agreement may be limited by applicable
law, including federal and state securities laws.

         (iii) Any writing furnished by the Parent  Company or  Pittston  to the
Underwriter  or Bond Counsel in  connection  with the sale of the Bonds will not
contain a materially false or misleading statement of fact.

         (iv) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) 90 days from the end
of the underwriting period or (ii)  the  time  when the  Official  Statement  is
available  to any  person  from a  Nationally  Recognized  Municipal  Securities
Information Repository ("NRMSIR") which has been so designated by the Securities
and Exchange  Commission pursuant to Rule 15c2-l2 under 1934 Act (but in no case
less than 25 days  following  the end of the  underwriting  period) if any event
occurs as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement  the Official
Statement,  in  order  to make  the  statements  in it not  contain  any  untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements  made in it, in the light of the  circumstances  when the
Official  Statement  is delivered to a  purchaser,  not  misleading,  the Parent
Company  and  Pittston,  at their  expense,  will  prepare  and  furnish  to the
Underwriter (and will file or cause the same to be filed with each NRMSIR having
the  Official  Statement on file and will mail or cause the same to be mailed to
each  record  owner of the Bonds)  amendments  or  supplements  to the  Official
Statement so that the statements  made in it, in the light of the  circumstances
when it is amended or  supplemented,  will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary to make the statements
in it not misleading.

         (v) The Parent Company agrees to pay the  Underwriter a fee of $323,700
in  connection with the Underwriter's offering  of the Bonds. The Parent Company
may presume for  purposes  of this  Section 3 that the  underwriting  period for

Parent  Company  is  otherwise  notified  in  writing  at  the  Closing  by  the
Underwriter.

Supplemental  Lease, the Indenture,  the Loan Agreement,  the Official Statement
and this Agreement and performance of its obligations in them, (2) the issuance,
sale and delivery of the Bonds upon the terms set forth in this  Agreement,  (3)
the  distribution  of  the  Preliminary  Official  Statement  and  the  Official
Statement  in  connection  with the sale of the Bonds and (4) the  taking of all
action  required  of the  Issuer  to  carry  out its  part  of the  transactions
contemplated by the Fifth Supplemental Lease, the Indenture, the Loan Agreement,

     (c) The Authorizing  Resolution  constitutes  the legal,  valid and binding
action of the Issuer, and the Fifth Supplemental Lease, the Indenture,  the Loan
Agreement and this  Agreement,  when executed and delivered by the other parties
to them, will constitute legal, valid and binding special,  limited  obligations
of the Issuer enforceable  against it in accordance with their terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy,  reorganization,  insolvency, moratorium or other similar
laws  affecting  the  enforcement  of  creditors'  rights  generally  and to the
availability  of equitable  remedies),  except as rights to indemnity under this
Agreement  may be  limited  by  applicable  law,  including  federal  and  state
securities laws.

     (d) When  authenticated and delivered to and paid for by the Underwriter in
accordance  with this  Agreement  the Bonds will be duly  authorized,  executed,
issued and  delivered  and will  constitute  legal,  valid and binding  special,

their terms.

     (e) The execution, delivery and performance by the Issuer of the Bonds, the
Fifth Supplemental  Lease, the Indenture,  the Loan Agreement and this Agreement

default under, the rules of procedure of the Issuer, or any indenture, mortgage,

                                        5

<PAGE>

deed of trust,  agreement  or  instrument  to which the  Issuer is a party or by
which it or any of its properties is bound, or any  constitutional  provision or
statute,  or any  rule,  regulation,  judgment,  order or decree of any court or
governmental  agency  or body to which the  Issuer is  subject,  or  (except  as
provided  in the  Fifth  Supplemental  Lease  and  the  granting  clause  of the
Indenture)  result in the creation or  imposition  of any lien,  charge or other
security interest or encumbrance on any of its properties.

     (f)  The  Issuer  has  complied  with  all  provisions  of the  laws of the
commonwealth in connection with the transactions contemplated to be performed by
it under the  Bonds,  the Fifth  Supplemental  Lease,  the  Indenture,  the Loan

     (g) Except as may be required  under blue sky or other  securities  laws of
any  state,  no  action  by any  governmental  or  regulatory  authority  of the

required  for the sale of the  Bonds or the  consummation  by the  Issuer of the
other transactions contemplated to be performed by it under the Bonds, the Fifth
Supplemental  Lease, the Indenture,  the Loan Agreement,  this Agreement and the
Official  Statement;  provided that no representation is made by the Issuer with
respect to compliance with filing,  registration or any other requirements under
Federal securities laws applicable to the sale of the Bonds.

     (h) There is no action, suit,  proceeding or investigation before or by any
court or  governmental  agency or body pending or, to the best  knowledge of the
Issuer,  threatened  against or  affecting  the Issuer to restrain or enjoin the
issuance, sale or delivery of the Bonds or collection of payments under the Loan
Agreement,  contesting or affecting the validity of the Authorizing  Resolution,
the Bonds, the Fifth  Supplemental  Lease, the Indenture,  the Loan Agreement or
this Agreement,  contesting the power of the Issuer to enter into or perform its
obligations under any of the foregoing or in which an unfavorable  outcome would
otherwise   adversely  affect  the   transactions   contemplated  by  the  Fifth
Supplemental  Lease,  the Indenture,  the Loan Agreement,  this Agreement or the
Official  Statement  or  the  validity  of  those  documents,   the  Authorizing
Resolution, the Bonds or the exemption of interest on the Bonds from Federal and

Statement as of its date did not, and such information in the Official Statement
does not,  and at the Closing  date will not,  contain any untrue or  misleading
statements of a material  fact or omit to state any material  fact  necessary to
make the statements  contained therein,  in the light of the circumstances under
which they were or are made, not misleading.

     (k) The Issuer  will  cooperate  with the  Underwriter  and its  counsel in
endeavoring  to qualify the Bonds for offering and sale under the  securities or
blue sky laws of such  jurisdictions of the United States as the Underwriter may
request,  but the Issuer will not be required to execute a consent to service of
process or qualify to do business in any  jurisdiction.  The Parent Company will
pay the expenses of any action under this paragraph.


                                        6

     (l)  Neither the Issuer nor anyone  acting in its behalf  has,  directly or
indirectly,  offered the Bonds or any similar  securities of the Issuer relating
in any way to the coal terminal  facilities  described in the Official Statement
(the "Project") for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy the same from, anyone
other than the Underwriter.

     (m) The  Issuer  will  apply  the  proceeds  from the sale of the  Bonds as
specified in the Indenture and the Loan  Agreement.  So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding and except as may be authorized by the Indenture,  the Issuer
will not issue or sell any  bonds or  obligations,  other  than the  Bonds,  the
principal  of or premium,  if any, or interest on which will be payable from the
property described in the granting clause of the Indenture.

     (n) The Issuer  will  cooperate  with the  Underwriter  and its  counsel in
applying for and securing a rating on the Bonds by Standard & Poor's Corporation
("S&P") and the Issuer  agrees that this  obligation  will  continue  until such
rating on the Bonds is secured.  The Parent Company will pay the expenses of any
action taken under this paragraph.

     (o) Any writing furnished by the Issuer to the Underwriters or McGuireWoods
LLP, Bond counsel,  will not contain a materially false or misleading  statement
of fact.

     Any  certificate  signed by any official of the Issuer and delivered to the
Underwriter  shall be deemed a representation  and warranty by the Issuer to the
Underwriter as to statements made therein.

Section 5.  Closing.  On or prior to 11:00 a.m.,  Eastern  time, on September 4,
2003, at the offices of McGuireWoods  LLP,  McLean,  Virginia,  or at such other
time or such other date or such other place as shall have been  mutually  agreed
upon by the  Partnership,  the  Issuer  and the  Underwriter,  the  Issuer  will
deliver, or cause to be delivered,  to the Underwriter,  the Bonds in definitive
form duly  executed  by the Issuer and  authenticated  by the  Trustee,  and the
Underwriter  will accept such delivery and pay the purchase  price of the Bonds,
subject  to the  provisions  hereof  including,  without  limitation,  Section 7
hereof.  Payment of the purchase price for the Bonds by the Underwriter  will be
made by wire transfer in immediately available funds, payable to the Trustee, as
provided  in the  Indenture,  or by such  other  means as is  acceptable  to the
Issuer,  the Partnership,  the Underwriter and the Trustee.  The above described
payment and delivery is herein called the "Closing."

     The Bonds will be delivered as one fully  registered bond registered in the
name of Cede & Co. and will be  available  for checking by the  Underwriter  not
less than one business day prior to the Closing at The Depository  Trust Company
("DTC") or its agent in New York, New York.

     It is anticipated that a CUSIP identification number will be printed on the
Bonds, but neither the failure to print such number on any Bond nor any error in
the printing of such number shall  constitute  cause for a failure or refusal by
the Underwriter to accept delivery of and pay for any Bonds.  The Issuer and the
Partnership will cooperate with the Underwriter to obtain the CUSIP number.

Section 6. Termination of Bond Purchase  Agreement.  The Underwriter  shall have
the right to cancel its  obligation  to  purchase  the Bonds if, on or after the
date hereof and on or before the date of Closing:  (i) (a) legislation  shall be
enacted by the House of  Representatives  or the Senate of the  Congress  of the
United  States,  or  recommended  by the  President of the United  States to the

either the House of  Representatives  or the Senate by any  committee  of either
body to which  such  legislation  has been  referred  for  consideration,  (b) a
decision  shall be  entered  by a court  established  under  Article  III of the
Constitution of the United States, or the Tax Court of the United States, or (c)

or  actively  considered  for  enactment  by the United  States  Congress,  or a
decision  by a court of the  United  States  shall be  rendered,  or a ruling or
regulation  by the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  or other  governmental
agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter shall be made or proposed,  the
effect of which is that (A) the Bonds, or any other "security" as defined in the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended and as then in effect (the "Securities Act"),
relating to the Bonds,  are not exempt from the  registration,  qualification or
other  requirements  of the  Securities  Act or the  Exchange  Act,  or (B)  the
Indenture  is  not  exempt  from  the   registration,   qualification  or  other

to permit the Official  Statement to be  supplemented  to correct or supply such
statement  or  information,  or the  effect  of  the  Official  Statement  as so
corrected or supplemented is, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter,  to

of the Bonds by the Underwriter at the contemplated  offering price;  (vi) there
shall have been a general  suspension  of trading in  securities on the New York
Stock  Exchange,  the American Stock Exchange,  the Pacific Stock Exchange,  the

established on any such  exchange,  or the daily volume or average prices on any
such exchange shall have  significantly  changed from the current  average daily
volume or level of prices,  the effect of any of which on the financial  markets
of the United  States is, in the  reasonable  judgment  of the  Underwriter,  to
materially adversely affect the market for the Bonds or the sale of the Bonds by
the Underwriter at the contemplated  offering price;  (vii) a banking moratorium
shall have been  declared by  federal,  Virginia  or New York  authorities  or a

Statement, the Partnership Documents, the Parent Company Documents, the Pittston
Documents or the Issuer Documents;  (ix) there shall be any litigation,  pending
or threatened,  which, in the reasonable  judgment of the Underwriter,  makes it

Underwriter  at, or at any time prior to, the  Closing by written  notice to the
Partnership and the Issuer.

Section 9.  Indemnification.  (a) The Parent  Company  will  indemnify  and hold
harmless the Underwriter, each of its directors, officers and employees and each
person who  controls  the  Underwriter  within the  meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities  Act (any such person being herein in this  paragraph  (a)  sometimes
called  an  "Indemnified  Party"),   against  all  losses,  claims,  damages  or
liabilities,  joint or  several,  to which  such  Indemnified  Party may  become
subject  under  any  statute  or at law or in  equity  or  otherwise,  and  will
reimburse any such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred by
it in  connection  with  investigating  any claims  against it and defending any
actions,  insofar as such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities or actions arise
out of or are based upon (1) an  allegation or  determination  that the Bonds or
the  obligations  of the Issuer  under the  Indenture,  the  obligations  of the
Partnership  under the Loan  Agreement,  the  obligations  of Pittston under the
Thoughput  Agreement or the  obligations  of the Parent Company under the Parent
Company  Guaranty,  should have been registered  under the Securities Act or the
Exchange  Act or the  Indenture  should  have  been  qualified  under  the Trust
Indenture Act, or (2) any untrue statement,  or alleged untrue  statement,  of a
material fact contained in the Official Statement or any amendment or supplement
to the Official Statement or the omission or alleged omission to state in them a
material fact necessary to make the statements in them not misleading,  except a
statement or omission under the heading "UNDERWRITING." The Parent Company shall
not be liable under this paragraph if the person asserting any such loss, claim,
damage or liability  purchased Bonds from the  Underwriter,  if delivery to such
person of the  Official  Statement  or any  amendment  of or  supplement  to the
Official Statement would have been a valid defense to the action from which such
loss, claim, damage or liability arose and if the Official Statement,  amendment
or  supplement  was  not  delivered  to  such  person  by or on  behalf  of  the
Underwriter.  This indemnity  agreement  will not limit any other  liability the
Parent Company may otherwise have to any such Indemnified Party.

     (b) The Parent Company will indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, each of
its  officials  and employees and each person who controls the Issuer within the
meaning of Section 15 of the  Securities  Act (any such person  being  herein in
this paragraph (b) sometimes called an "Indemnified Party"), against all losses,
claims,  damages or  liabilities,  joint or several,  to which such  Indemnified
Party may become  subject under any statute or at law or in equity or otherwise,

                                       11

<PAGE>

and will  reimburse any such  Indemnified  Party for any legal or other expenses
incurred  by it in  connection  with  investigating  any  claims  against it and
defending any actions,  insofar as such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities or
actions arise out of or are based upon (1) an allegation or  determination  that
the Bonds or the obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture,  the obligations
of the Partnership  under the Loan Agreement,  the obligations of Pittston under
the  Thoughput  Agreement or the  obligations  of the Parent  Company  under the
Parent Company Guaranty, should have been registered under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act or the  Indenture  should have been  qualified  under the Trust
Indenture Act, or (2) any untrue statement,  or alleged untrue  statement,  of a
material fact contained in the Official Statement or any amendment or supplement
to the Official Statement or the omission or alleged omission to state in them a
material fact necessary to make the statements in them not misleading; provided,
however,  that the  Parent  Company  shall not be liable in any such case to the
Issuer to the extent that any such loss,  claim,  damage or liability arises out
of or is based upon an untrue  statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged  omission  made in the Official  Statement  or any such  amendment or
supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
by the Issuer expressly for use therein.

     (c) The  Underwriter  will  indemnify  and hold  harmless  the Issuer,  the
Partnership,   Pittston  and  the  Parent   Company,   each  of  their  members,
commissioners,  directors, officers, officials and employees and each person who
controls any of them within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (for
purposes of this  paragraph  (c), an  "Indemnified  Party")  against all losses,
damages or liabilities,  joint or several,  to which such Indemnified  Party may
become  subject under any statute or at law or in equity or otherwise,  and will
reimburse any such Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses incurred by
it in connection  with defending any actions,  insofar as such losses,  damages,
liabilities or actions arise out of or are based upon any untrue  statement of a
material fact contained in the Official Statement or any amendment or supplement
to the  Official  Statement  or the  omission  to state in them a material  fact
necessary to make the statements in them not misleading, but only with reference
to written information relating to the Underwriter  furnished by the Underwriter
specifically  for use in the  preparation  of the  documents  referred to in the
foregoing  indemnity.  The  Issuer,  the  Partnership,  Pittston  and the Parent
Company  acknowledge  that the  statements in the Official  Statement  under the
heading  "UNDERWRITING"  constitute the only information furnished in writing by
or on behalf of the Underwriter for inclusion in the Official  Statement and the
Underwriter confirm that such statements are correct.

     (d) An  Indemnified  Party (as defined in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this
Section 9) will,  promptly after  receiving  notice of the  commencement  of any
action against such Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnification may be
sought against the Parent Company or the Underwriter, as the case may be (in any
case the "Indemnifying Party"),  notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the
commencement of the action. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
will  reduce the  liability  of the  Indemnifying  Party  under  this  indemnity
agreement by the amount of the damages  attributable  to the failure to give the
notice;  but the  failure  will not  relieve  the  Indemnifying  Party  from any
liability  it may  have to such  Indemnified  Party  otherwise  than  under  the
indemnity  agreement  in this  Section.  If such  action is  brought  against an
Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying  Party of
its  commencement,  the  Indemnifying  Party  may,  or if so  requested  by  the
Indemnified Party shall,  participate in it or assume its defense,  with counsel


                                       12


<PAGE>

reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Indemnified  Party,  and after notice from the
Indemnifying  Party to the  Indemnified  Party that it will not be liable to the
Indemnified   Party  under  this  Section  for  any  legal  or  other   expenses
subsequently  incurred by such Indemnified  Party,  the  Indemnifying  Party may
participate at its own expense in the defense of the action. If the Indemnifying
Party  does  not  employ  counsel  to  have  charge  of  the  defense  or if any
Indemnified Party reasonably  concludes that there may be defenses  available to
it or them which are  different  from or in addition to those  available  to the
Indemnifying Party (in which case the Indemnifying Party will not have the right
to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party), legal
and  other  expenses  incurred  by such  Indemnified  Party  will be paid by the
Indemnifying  Party. Any obligation under this Section of an Indemnifying  Party
to reimburse an Indemnified  Party for expenses  includes the obligation to make
advances to the Indemnified  Party to cover such expenses in reasonable  amounts
and at reasonable periodic intervals not more often than monthly as requested by
the  Indemnified  Party.  An  Indemnifying  Party  shall not be  liable  for any
settlement of any proceeding affected without its written consent but if settled
with  such  consent  or if  there  be a final  judgment  for the  plaintiff,  an
Indemnifying  Party shall indemnify the  Indemnified  Party from and against any
loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

     (e)  In  order  to  provide  for  just  and   equitable   contribution   in
circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) of this
Section  is due in  accordance  with its terms but is for any  reason  held by a
court to be  unavailable  from the  Parent  Company  on  grounds  of  policy  or
otherwise,  the Parent Company and the Underwriter shall contribute to the total
losses,  claims,  damages and liabilities  (including legal or other expenses of
investigation  or  defense) to which they may be subject in such  proportion  so
that the Underwriter is responsible for the percentage that the underwriting fee
is of the sum of such fee and the  purchase  price  of the  Bonds  specified  in
Section l and the Parent Company is responsible for the balance.  However, in no
case will the  Underwriter  be  responsible  for any amounts in the aggregate in
excess  of  the   underwriting   fee,  and  no  person   guilty  of   fraudulent
misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of the Securities  Act)
will be  entitled  to  contribution  from any  person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 9(e) each person who
controls  either of the  Underwriter  within  the  meaning  of Section 15 of the
Securities Act will have the same rights to contribution as the Underwriter, and
each person who controls the Parent Company within the meaning of the Securities
Act and each officer and each director of the Parent  Company will have the same
rights to contribution as the Parent Company, subject to the foregoing sentence.
Any party entitled to  contribution  will,  promptly after  receiving  notice of
commencement of any action,  suit or proceeding against such party in respect of
which a claim for  contribution  may be made under this  paragraph,  notify each
party from whom  contribution  may be sought,  but the  omission  to notify such
party shall not relieve any party from whom  contribution may be sought from any
other obligation it may have otherwise than under this paragraph.

     (f) No right or remedy  granted in this  Section 9 is  intended  to limit a
party's access to the courts to pursue other rights or remedies  provided by law
or in equity.

Section 10.  Survival of  Indemnities,  Representations,  Warranties,  Etc.  The
indemnities,  covenants,  agreements,  representations,   warranties  and  other
statements of the Issuer,  the Underwriter,  the  Partnership,  Pittston and the
Parent Company,  as set forth in this Bond Purchase  Agreement or made by any of

                                       13

<PAGE>

them  pursuant to this Bond Purchase  Agreement,  shall remain in full force and
effect,  regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Issuer, the
Underwriter,  the  Partnership,  Pittston,  the  Parent  Company or any of their
officers or directors or any controlling  person,  and shall survive delivery of
and payment for the Bonds.  The obligations of the  Partnership  under Section 9
hereof shall  survive any  termination  of this Bond  Purchase  Agreement by the
Underwriter pursuant to its terms.

Section 11.  Expenses.  The Parent  Company  shall pay any  reasonable  expenses
incident to the  performance  of the  obligations  hereunder  including  but not
limited to: (i) the cost of the preparation  and printing of the Indenture,  the
Loan Agreement,  the Parent Company Guaranty,  this Bond Purchase  Agreement and
the  Continuing  Disclosure  Undertaking,  together with a reasonable  number of
copies thereof;  (ii) the cost of the preparation,  printing and delivery of the
Preliminary  Official  Statement  and the Official  Statement,  together  with a
reasonable  number of copies  thereof;  (iii) the cost of the preparation of the
Bonds; (iv) the fees and  disbursements of Counsel to the Partnership,  Pittston
and the Parent Company and of any other experts or  consultants  retained by the
Partnership, Pittston or the Parent Company or the Underwriter; (v) the fees and
disbursements  of Counsel passing upon certain matters for the  Underwriter,  of
Counsel to the  Issuer  and of Bond  Counsel;  (vi) the fees,  if any,  for Bond
ratings;  (vii) the  expenses  of the Issuer  incurred  in  connection  with the
issuance of the Bonds;  and (viii) all  registration  or filing fees and related
costs and expenses  incurred in connection with the  qualification  of the Bonds
under state security (or "blue sky") laws and the  preparation and printing of a
blue sky survey  and legal  investment  memorandum  relating  to the Bonds.  The
Parent  Company  may pay such  expenses  from the  proceeds  of the Bonds to the
extent  legally  permissible  and which will not adversely  affect the exclusion
from federal gross income of interest on the Bonds.

Section 12.  Representation  by Counsel.  It is understood by the parties hereto
that, in connection with the transactions  described herein,  the Issuer will be
represented by Kaufman & Canoles, P.C., that the Partnership will be represented
by McGuireWoods LLP, that Pittston will be represented by in-house counsel, that
the  Parent  Company  will  be  represented  by  in-house   counsel,   and  that
McGuireWoods LLP will serve as Bond Counsel and Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P. will
serve as counsel to the Underwriter.

Section 13. Parent Company Liability for Obligations of Partnership.  The Parent
Company  acknowledges  that it will have sole  liability  for any  breach of the
Partnership's  representations  and warranties set forth in Section 3(a) of this
Agreement.  The  Underwriter  agrees  that  in  the  event  of a  breach  of any
representation  and warranty made by the  Partnership  under this  Agreement its
recourse  shall be against the Parent Company under Section 9 hereof not against
the Partnership.

Section 14. Miscellaneous.  (a) Any notice or other communication to be given to

Purchase  Agreement  shall be deemed  given  when  delivered  in person to their
