The following exhibits are attached to this Lease and are made parts of this Lease: First Addendum and Exhibits "A" and "B", attached thereto.
ARTICLE 2. AGREEMENT
Landlord leases the Premises to Tenant, and Tenant leases the Premises from Landlord, according to this Lease.
ARTICLE 3. TERM, DELIVERY AND ACCEPTANCE OF PREMISES
3.1 General. The duration of this Lease will be the Term. See First Addendum
3.2 Delivery of Possession. Landlord will construct or install in the Premises the improvements to be constructed or installed by Landlord according to the First Addendum and further defined in the architectural permitted working drawings. Landlord will be deemed to have delivered possession of the Premises to Tenant on the Early Possession Date. See First Addendum. 3.3 Failure to Deliver Possession. If, for any reason, Landlord cannot deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant on the Commencement Date:
     (a) This Lease will not be void or voidable; and
     (b) Landlord will not be liable to Tenant for any resultant loss or damage; and
     (c) If delivery of possession of the Premises to Tenant on the Commencement Date is delayed by Landlord, (i) Rent will be waived for the period between the original Commencement Date and the date on which Landlord delivers possession of the Premises to Tenant, (ii) the original Commencement Date and Expiration Date will be extended automatically one day for each day of delay after the original Commencement Date and before delivery of possession, and (iii) Landlord and Tenant will execute a certificate of the new Commencement Date and Expiration Date promptly after delivery of possession.
3.4 Early Entry. If Tenant is permitted entry to the Premises prior to the Early Possession Date for the purpose of installing fixtures or any other purpose permitted by Landlord, such early entry will be at Tenant's sole risk and subject to all the terms and provisions of this Lease as though the Early Possession Date had occurred, except for the payment of Monthly Rent which will commence on the Commencement Date. Tenant, its agents or employees, will not interfere with or delay Landlord's completion of construction of the improvements. All rights of Tenant under this Section 3.4 will be subject to the requirements of all applicable building codes and zoning requirements so as not to interfere with Landlord's obtaining a certificate of occupancy for the Premises. Landlord has the right to impose such additional conditions on Tenant's early entry as Landlord, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, and will further have the right to require that Tenant execute an early entry agreement containing such conditions prior to Tenant's early entry.
3.5 Condition of the Premises. Prior to the Early Possession Date, Tenant will conduct a walk-through inspection of the Premises with Landlord and prepare a punch-list of items needing additional work by Landlord. Other than the items specified in the punch-list, by taking possession of the Premises, Tenant will be deemed to have accepted the Premises in their condition on the date of delivery of possession. The same procedure shall apply to the First Additional Space and Section Additional Space. The punch-list will not include any damage to the Premises caused by Tenant's move-in or early access, if permitted. Damage caused by Tenant will be repaired or corrected by Landlord, at Tenant's expense. Tenant acknowledges that neither Landlord nor its agents or employees have made any representations or warranties as to the suitability or fitness of the Premises for the conduct of Tenant's business or for any other purpose, nor has Landlord or its agents or employees agreed to undertake any alterations or construct any Tenant improvements to the Premises except as expressly provided in this Lease. Landlord's contractor will complete all reasonable punch-list items within thirty (30) days

3.6 Adjustments Upon Completion. As soon as practicable, upon completion of the improvements in accordance with the Work Letter, Landlord will notify Tenant of the Rentable Area of the Premises, the Rentable Area of the Building, Monthly Rent, and Tenant's Share, if such information was not previously determinable by Landlord. At Landlord's request, Tenant will promptly execute a certificate confirming such information.
ARTICLE 4. MONTHLY RENT, RENTAL ADJUSTMENT AND CONVERSION
4.1 Monthly Rent. Throughout the Term of this Lease, Tenant will pay Monthly Rent to Landlord as rent for the Premises. Monthly Rent will be paid in advance, on or before the first day of each calendar month of the Term. If the Term commences on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, the Monthly Rent will be appropriately prorated by Landlord for such month. If the Term commences on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, then prorated Monthly Rent for such month will be paid on or before the first day of the Term. Monthly Rent will be paid to Landlord, without notice or demand, and without deduction or offset, in lawful money of the United States of America at Landlord's Address, or to such other person or at any other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing.
ARTICLE 5. OPERATING EXPENSES
5.1 General: This Lease shall be deemed a modified gross lease and Tenant shall do all acts and make all payments pro-rata, connected with or arising out of any increase of operating expenses for the Office Building over Tenant's expense base, in addition to Tenant's Base Rent. This includes, without limitation, all taxes and assessments, and any increases in all taxes and assessments, whether now or hereafter existing, levied or imposed on Landlord or Tenant, and whether foreseen or unforeseen. In addition to Monthly Rent, Tenant will pay Tenant's Monthly Share of the Increased Current Operating Expenses of the Office Building. Landlord agrees to cap the annual increases of the "Controllable Expenses" ("Controllable Expenses" shall be defined as every expense set forth below except for all utilities, all insurance and all taxes which shall be excluded) at five percent (5.0%) per year on a cumulative basis.
As used in this Lease, the term "Operating Expenses" includes:
(a) all reasonable costs of management, operation and maintenance of the Project, including without limitation, real and personal property taxes and assessments (and any tax levied in whole or in part in lieu of or in addition to real property taxes), wages, salaries and compensation of employees, consulting, accounting, legal and, maintenance, guard and other services, management fees (charged by Landlord, any affiliate of Landlord, or any other entity managing the Project), reasonable reserves for Operating Expenses, that part of office rent or rental value of space in the Project used by Landlord to manage, operate and maintain the Project or furnished by Landlord to enhance the management, operation or maintenance of the Project, power, water, waste disposal and other utilities, materials and supplies, maintenance and repairs, insurance obtained with respect to the Project, depreciation on personal property and equipment (which is or should be capitalized on the books of Landlord), and any other costs, charges, and expenses which under generally accepted accounting principles, would be regarded as management, maintenance and operating expenses; and
(b) the cost (amortized over such period as Landlord will reasonably determine) together with interest at the greater of (i) the Prime Rate prevailing plus two percent (2%) or (ii) Landlord's borrowing rate for such capital improvements plus two percent (2%), on the unamortized balance of any capital expenditures which are made to the Project by Landlord (A) for the purposes of reducing Operating Expenses, or (B) after the Date and which were required under any governmental law or regulation that was not applicable to the Project at the time it was constructed and which are not a result of the nature of Tenant's use of the Premises.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant has agreed to pay for certain expenses, as set forth in the First Addendum.
The Operating Expenses will not include (1) depreciation on the Project (other than depreciation on personal property, equipment, window coverings on exterior windows provided by Landlord and carpeting in public corridors and common areas); (2) costs of improvements made for tenants of the Project; (3) finders fees and real estate brokers' commission; (4) mortgage principal or interest; and (5) capital items other than those referred to in clause (b), above.
Tenant acknowledges that Landlord has not made any representation or given Tenant any assurances that the Operating Expenses will equal or approximate any actual amount per square foot of Rentable Area of the Premises, for any calendar year during the Term.
5.2 Estimated Payments: In addition to Monthly Rent, Tenant will pay to Landlord on the first day of each month during the Term, one-twelfth (1/12) of Landlord's estimate of the Additional Rent payable by Tenant pursuant to Section 5.1, above, during the subject calendar year or partial calendar year (the "Additional Rent"). The Additional Rent is subject to revision according to the further provisions of this Section 5.2 and Section 5.3, below. During December of each calendar year, or as soon after December as practicable, Landlord will give Tenant written notice of Additional Rent for the ensuing calendar year. On or before the first day of each month during the ensuing calendar year, Tenant will pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12) of the Additional Rent; however, if such notice is not given in December, Tenant will continue to pay on the basis of the prior year's Additional Rent until the month after such notice is given. In the month Tenant first pays Landlord's new Additional Rent, Tenant will pay to Landlord the difference between the new Additional Rent estimate and the amount payable to Landlord for the prior year's Additional Rent, for each month which has elapsed since December. If, at
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials 
5

 
any time or times it reasonably appears to Landlord that the amount payable under Section 5.1 above, for the current calendar year will vary from the Additional Rent, Landlord may, by written notice to Tenant, revise the Estimate Operating Expense for such year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for such year will be based upon Landlord's reasonably revised estimate.
5.3 Annual Settlement. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each calendar year or as soon after such one hundred twenty (120) day period as practicable, Landlord will deliver to Tenant a statement of amounts payable under Section 5.1, above, for such calendar year prepared and certified by Landlord. Such certified statement will be final and binding upon Landlord within thirty (30) days after it is given to Tenant. If such statement shows an amount owing by Tenant that is less than the estimated payments previously made by Tenant for such calendar year, the excess will be held by Landlord and credited against the next payment of Rent; however, if the Term has ended and Tenant was not in default at its end, Landlord will refund the excess payment previously made by Tenant for such calendar year, if such statement shows a balance due from Tenant, Tenant will pay the deficiency to Landlord within thirty (30) days after the delivery of such statement. Tenant may review Landlord's records of the Operating Expenses, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, at the place Landlord normally maintains such records during Landlord's normal business hours.
5.4 Final Proration. If this Lease ends on a day other than the last day of a calendar year, the amount of increase (if any) in the Operating Expenses payable by Tenant applicable to the calendar year in which this Lease ends will be calculated on the basis of the number of days of the Term falling within such calendar year and Tenant's obligation to pay the amount so determined will survive the end of this Lease.
5.5 Other Taxes. Tenant will reimburse Landlord upon demand for any and all taxes payable by Landlord (other than net income taxes) whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of Landlord and Tenant:
(a) Upon, measured by or reasonably attributable to the cost or value of Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures and other personal property located in the Premises or by the cost or value of any leasehold improvements made in or to the Premises by or for Tenant, regardless of whether title to such improvements is in Tenant or Landlord;
(b) upon or measured by Rent, including without limitation, any gross income tax or excise tax levied by the Federal government or any other governmental body with respect to the receipt of Rent;
(c) upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion of the Premises; and
(d) upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises.
If it is not lawful for Tenant to reimburse Landlord, the Rent payable to Landlord under this Lease will be revised to yield to Landlord the same net rental after the imposition of any such tax upon Landlord as would have been payable to Landlord prior to the imposition of any such tax.
     Tenant will pay promptly when due all personal property taxes on Tenant's personal property in the Premises and any other taxes payable by Tenant, the non-payment of which might give rise to a lien on the Premises or Tenant's interest in the Premises.
5.6 Rent Payable. Amounts payable by Tenant as provided herein, will be payable as Rent without deduction or offset, except as otherwise provided within this Lease. If Tenant fails to pay any amounts due, Landlord will have all the rights and remedies available to it on account of Tenant's failure to pay Rent.
ARTICLE 6. INSURANCE
6.1 Landlord's Insurance. At all times during the Term, Landlord will carry and maintain:
(a) fire and extended coverage insurance covering the Project, parking structure (if any), the Building's equipment and common area furnishings, and leasehold improvements in the Premises); and
(b) public liability and property damage insurance; and
(c) such other insurance as Landlord determines from time to time.
The insurance coverages and amounts in this Section 6.1 will be determined by Landlord.
6.2 Tenant's Insurance. At all times during the Term, Tenant will carry and maintain, at Tenant's expense, the following insurance, in the amounts specified below or such other amounts as Landlord may from time to time reasonably request, with insurance companies and on forms satisfactory to Landlord:

All such insurance will specifically include without limitation, contractual liability coverage for the performance by Tenant of the indemnity agreements set forth in Article 21 of this Lease, below; and
(b) insurance covering all of Tenant's equipment, trade fixtures, appliances, furniture, furnishings and personal property from time to time in, on or upon the Premises, and any leasehold improvements to the

Premises in excess of the Tenant Finish Allowance, in an amount not less than the full replacement cost without deduction for depreciation from time to time during the term of this Lease, providing protection against all perils included within the classification of fire, extended coverage, vandalism, malicious mischief, special extended peril (all risk), boiler, flood, glass breakage and sprinkler leakage. All policy proceeds will be used for the repair or replacement of the property damaged or destroyed, however, if this Lease ceased under the provisions of Article 18 below, Tenant will be entitled to any proceeds resulting from damage to Tenant's equipment, trade fixtures, appliances, furniture, furnishings, and personal property, and Landlord will be entitled to all other proceeds; and
(c) workmen's compensation insurance insuring against and satisfying Tenant's obligations and liabilities under the workmen's compensation law of the state in which the Premises are located.
6.3 Forms of the Policies. All policies of insurance which Tenant is obligated to maintain according to this Lease (other than any policy of workmen's compensation insurance) will name Landlord and such other persons or firms as Landlord reasonably specifies from time to time as additional insured. Original or copies of original policies (together with copies of the endorsements naming Landlord, and any others specified by Landlord as additional insured) and evidence of the payment of all premiums of such policies will be delivered to Landlord prior to Tenant's occupancy of the Premises and from time to time around the expiration of the term of each such policy. All public liability and property damage liability insurance policies maintained by Tenant will contain a provision that Landlord and any other additional insured will be entitled to recover under such policies for any loss sustained by them, their agents and employees as a result of the acts or omissions of Tenant. All such policies maintained by Tenant will provide that they may not be terminated or amended except with written notice to Landlord given within a reasonable period of time. All public liability, property damage, liability and casualty policies maintained by Tenant will be written as primary policies, not contributing with and not supplemental to the coverage that Landlord may carry. Insurance required to be maintained by Tenant by this Article 6 may be subject to a deductible of up to $1,000.00.
6.4 Waiver of Subrogation. Except as otherwise provided herein, Landlord and Tenant each waive any and all rights to recover against the other or against any other Tenant or occupant of the Project, or against the officers, directors, shareholders, partners, joint venturers, employees, agents, customers, invitees or business visitors of such other party or of such other Tenant of occupancy of the Project, for any loss or damage to such waiving party arising from any cause covered by any insurance required by such party pursuant to this Article 6 or any other insurance actually carried by such party to the extent of the limits of such policy. Landlord and Tenant, from time to time, will cause their respective insurers to issue appropriate waiver of subrogation rights endorsements to all policies of insurance carried in connection with the Project or the Premises claiming by, under or through Tenant to execute and deliver to Landlord such a waiver of claims and to obtain such waiver of subrogation rights endorsements.
6.5 Adequacy of Coverage. Landlord, its agents and employees, make no representation that the limits of liability specified to be carried by Tenant pursuant to this Article 6 are adequate to protect Tenant. If Tenant believes that any of such insurance coverage is inadequate, Tenant will obtain such additional insurance coverage as Tenant deems adequate, at Tenant's sole expense.
ARTICLE 7. USE

If this Lease is assigned, or if the Premises or any part of the Premises are subleased or occupied by anyone other than Tenant, Landlord may, after default by Tenant, collect rent from the assignee, subtenant or occupant, and apply the new amount collected to Rent. No assignment, sublease, occupancy or collection will be deemed a waiver of the provisions of this Section 9.1, and acceptance by Landlord of the assignee, subtenant or occupant as Tenant, shall not release Tenant from the further performance by Tenant of covenants on the part of Tenant contained in this Lease. The consent by Landlord to an assignment or sublease will not be construed to relieve Tenant from obtaining Landlord's prior written consent in each instance.
9.2 Landlord's Right to Recapture. If Tenant desires to assign all or part of this Lease or to sublease all or any portion of the Premises, Tenant will first submit to Landlord the documents described in Section 9.3, below, and will offer in writing,(a) with respect to a prospective assignment, to assign this Lease to Landlord without any payment of money or other consideration for such assignment, or (b) with respect to a prospective sublease, to sublease to Landlord the portion of the Premises involved ("Leaseback Area") for the term specified by Tenant in its offer and at the lower of (i) Tenant's proposed sub-rental or (i) the rate of Monthly Rent and Additional Rent then in effect according to this Lease, and on the same terms, covenants and conditions contained under Lease and applicable to the Leaseback Area. The offer will specify the date when the Leaseback Area will be made available to Landlord. That dale will not be earlier than thirty (30) days nor later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of Landlord's acceptance of the offer. If an offer of sublease is made, it will also specify the term of the proposed sublease except that if the proposed sublease will result in all or substantially all of the Premises being subleased, then Landlord will have the option to extend the term of the proposed sublease for the balance of the Term of this Lease less one (1) day.
     Landlord will have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the offer either to accept or reject it. If Landlord accepts the offer, Tenant will then execute and deliver to Landlord, or to anyone designated or named by Landlord, an assignment or sublease, as the case may be, in either case in a form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord's counsel.
     If such a sublease is made to Landlord or its designee, such sublease will expressly:
(a) permit Landlord to make further subleases of all or any part of the Leaseback Area and to make and authorize any and all changes, alterations, installations and improvements in such space as Landlord deems necessary for such subletting, at Landlord's expense;
(b) provide that Tenant will permit reasonably appropriate means of ingress to and egress from the Leaseback Area at all times;
(c) negate any intention that the estate created under such sublease be merged with any other estate held by Landlord or Tenant;
(d) provide that Landlord will accept the Leaseback Area "as is" except that Landlord, at Tenant�s
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials

expense, will perform all such work and make all such alterations as may be required physically to separate the Leaseback Area from the remainder of the Premises and to permit lawful occupancy; and
(e) provide that at the expiration of the term of such sublease, Tenant will accept the Leaseback Area as may be reasonably necessary to preserve the Leaseback Area in good order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.
      Performance by Landlord, or its designee, under a sublease of the Leaseback Area will be deemed performance by Tenant of any similar obligation under this Lease. Tenant will not be liable for any default under this Lease or deemed to be in default under this Lease if such default is occasioned by or arises from any act or omission of any occupant holding under or pursuant to any such sublease.
9.3 Submission of Information. If Tenant requests Landlord's consent to a specific assignment or subletting, Tenant will submit in writing to Landlord (a) the name and address of the proposed assignee or subtenant, (b) a counterpart of the proposed agreement of assignment or sublease, (c) reasonably satisfactory information as to the nature and character of the business of the proposed assignee or subtenant, and as to the nature of its proposed use of the space, (d) reasonable assurances from Tenant that the proposed assignee or subtenant is financially responsible and of sufficient character, and (e)any and all financial information or statements of the proposed assignee or subtenant requested by Landlord.
9.4 Consent Not to be Unreasonably Withheld. If Landlord does not accept Tenant's offer within thirty (30) days after receipt of it, as provided in Section 9.2, above, then Landlord will not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to Tenant's request for consent to such specific assignment if the conditions in Section 9.3, above, and all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The proposed transferee is at least as creditworthy as Tenant when Tenant entered into this Lease, and satisfied Landlord's then-current credit standards for tenants of the Building, and in Landlord's opinion has the financial strength and stability to perform all obligations under this Lease to be performed by Tenant as and when they fall due.
(b) The proposed transferee will make use of the Premises which in Landlord's opinion (i) is lawful,(ii) is consistent with the permitted use of the Premises under this Lease, (iii) is consistent with the general character of business carried on by tenants of a first class office building, (iv) does not conflict with any exclusive rights or covenants not to compete in favor of any other Tenant or proposed Tenant in the Project,(v) will not increase the likelihood of damage or destruction, (vi) will not increase the rate of wear and tear to the Premises, Building common facilities, or Project, (vii) will not likely cause an increase in insurance premiums for insurance policies applicable to the Project, and (viii) will not require Tenant improvements incompatible with then existing Building or Project systems and components.
(c) Tenant pays Landlord's reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with negotiation, review and processing of the transfer, plus a processing fee not to exceed $500.00 for each such request.

Tenant shall have the burden of demonstrating that each of the foregoing conditions is satisfied.
9.5 Form of Assignment or Sublease. If Landlord consents to a proposed assignment or sublease, Landlord will give Tenant's form of assignment or sublease, as the case may be, which is acceptable to Landlord and will provide, among other things, that Tenant will remain liable under this Lease. Any sublease will provide, among other things, that the subtenant will comply with all applicable terms and conditions of this Lease. Any assignment will contain, among other things, an assumption by the assignee of all of the terms, covenants and conditions which this Lease requires Tenant to perform. Landlord's consent will not be effective unless and until Tenant (a) delivers to Landlord an original duly executed assignment or sublease, as the case may be, in the form provided by Landlord, and (b) pays Landlord the amounts required under Section 9.4(c), above.
9.6 Payments to Landlord for Assignment. If Landlord consents to a proposed assignment, then Landlord will have the right to require Tenant to pay to Landlord a sum equal to: (a) any rent or other consideration paid to Tenant by any proposed transferee which (after deducting the costs of Tenant, if any, in effecting the assignment, including reasonable alteration
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials

(b) The transfer of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of any corporate Tenant or subtenant of this Lease or a majority of the total interest in any partnership Tenant or subtenant, however accomplished, and whether in a single transaction or in a series of related or unrelated transactions, will be deemed an assignment of this Lease or of such sublease requiring Landlord's consent in each instance. For purposes of this Article 9, the transfer of outstanding capital stock of any corporate Tenant will not include any sale of such stock by persons (other than those deemed "insiders" within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) effected through "over-the-counter-market" or through any recognized stock exchange.
9.8 Permitted Transfer. Subject to Sections 9.5, 9.6 and 9.10, Landlord consents to an assignment of this Lease, or sublease of all or part of the Premises, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tenant or the parent of Tenant or to any corporation into or with which Tenant may be merged or consolidated.
9.9 Limitation on Remedies. Tenant will not be entitled to make, nor will Tenant make, any claim, and Tenant by this Section 9.9 waives any claim, for money damages (nor will Tenant claim any money damages by way of set-off, counterclaim or defense) based upon any claim or assertion by Tenant that Landlord has unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed its consent or approval to a proposed assignment as provided for in this Section. Tenant's sole remedy will be an action or proceeding to enforce any such provision, or for specific performance, injunction, or declaratory judgment.
9.10 Consent of Mortgage. Any transfer for which consent is required of any party having a mortgage, deed of trust or other encumbrance on, or of any lessor under any ground or underlying lease of, all or any part of the Project shall not be effective unless and until such consent is given.
ARTICLE 10. RULES AND REGULATIONS
     Landlord may from time to time reasonably amend, delete or modify existing rules and regulations, or adopt reasonable new rules and regulations for the use, safety, cleanliness and care of the Premises, the Building, and the Project, and the comfort, quiet enjoyment and convenience of occupants of the Project. Modifications or additions to the rules and regulations will be effective upon notice to Tenant from Landlord. In the event of any breach of any rules or regulations or any amendments or additions to such rules and regulations, Landlord will have all remedies which this Lease provides for default by Tenant, and will, in addition, have any remedies available at law or in equity, including the right to enjoin any breach of such rules and regulations. Landlord will not be liable to Tenant for violations such rules and regulations by any other Tenant, its employees, agents, visitors or licensees or any other person. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Lease and the rules and regulations, the provisions of this Lease will govern.
ARTICLE 11. COMMON AREAS
     As used in this Lease, the term "common areas" means, without limitation, the hallways, entryways, parking areas, driveways, walkways, terraces, loading areas, trash facilities and all other areas and facilities in the Project which are provided and designated from time to time by Landlord for the general nonexclusive use and convenience of Tenant with Landlord and other tenants of the Project and their respective employees, invitees, licensees or other visitors. Landlord grants Tenant, its employees, invitees, licensees and other visitors a nonexclusive license for the Term to use the common areas in common with others entitled to use the common areas, subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease. Without advance notice to Tenant (except with respect to matters covered by Subsection (a) below) and without any liability to Tenant in any respect, Landlord will have the right to:
     (a) establish and enforce reasonable rules and regulations concerning the maintenance, management, use and operation of the common areas;
     (b) close off any of the common areas to whatever extent required in the opinion of Landlord and its counsel to prevent a dedication of any of the common areas or the accrual of any rights by any person or the public to the common areas, provided such closure does not deprive Tenant of the substantial benefit and enjoyment of the Premises;
     (c) Temporarily close any of the common areas for maintenance, alteration or improvement purposes;
     (d) Select, appoint or contract with any person for the purpose of operating and maintaining the common areas, on such terms and conditions as Landlord deems reasonable;
     (e) change the size, use, shape or nature of any such common areas, provided such change does not deprive Tenant of the substantial benefit and enjoyment of the Premises. So long as Tenant is not thus deprived of the substantial use and benefit of the Premises, Landlord will also have the right at any time to change the arrangement or location of, or both, or to regulate or eliminate the use of any concourse, parking spaces, toilets or other public conveniences in the Project, without
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials 
10

 
incurring any liability to Tenant or entitling Tenant to any abatement of rent and such action will not constitute an actual or constructive eviction of Tenant; and
     (f) erect one or more additional building on the common areas, expand the existing Building or other buildings to cover a portion of the common areas, convert common areas to a portion of the Building (excluding the Premises) or other buildings to common areas. Upon erection of any additional buildings or change in common areas, the portion of the Project upon which buildings or structures have been erected will no longer be deemed to be a part of the common areas. In the event of any such changes in the size or use of the Building or common areas of the Building or Project, Landlord may make an appropriate adjustment in the Rentable Area of the Building or the Building's pro rata share of exterior common areas of the Project, as appropriate, and a corresponding adjustment to Tenant's Share of the Operating Expenses payable pursuant to Articles 5 of this Lease, above.

Tenant submitted service requests shall be deemed approved unless otherwise declined by Landlord within two business days from time of submission. However, those service requests classified as High Priority (as hereinafter defined) shall be deemed automatically approved. Approval of Tenant submitted service requests shall not be unreasonably withheld by Landlord. Landlord agrees not to withhold reimbursement for maintenance and repairs paid for by Tenant. Landlord further agrees that in the event it fails to reimburse Tenant for maintenance or repairs paid for by Tenant within ninety (90) days of presentation by Tenant to Landlord, Tenant may deduct the cost from the next month's Monthly Rent.

Landlord reserves the right temporarily to discontinue such services, or any of them, at such times as may be necessary by reason of accident, repairs, alterations or improvements, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of God, governmental preemption in connection with a national or local emergency, any rule, order or regulation of any governmental agency, conditions of supply and demand which make any product unavailable. Landlord's compliance with any mandatory governmental energy conservation or environmental protection program, or any voluntary governmental energy conservation program at the request of or with consent or acquiescence of Tenant, or any other happening beyond the control of Landlord. Landlord will not be liable to Tenant or any other person or entity for direct or consequential damages resulting from the admission to or exclusion from the Building or Project of any person. In the event of invasion, mob, riot, public excitement or other circumstances rendering such action advisable in Landlord's sole opinion, Landlord will have the right to prevent access to the Building or Project during the continuance of the same by such means as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate, including, without limitation, locking doors and closing parking areas and other common areas. Landlord will not be liable for damages to person or property or for injury to, or interruption of, business for any discontinuance permitted under this Article 12, nor will such discontinuance in any way be construed as an eviction of Tenant or cause an abatement of Rent or operate to release Tenant from any of Tenant's obligations under this Lease.
ARTICLE 13. TENANT's CARE OF THE PREMISES

If Tenant is not then in default, Tenant may remove from the Premises any trade fixtures, equipment and movable furniture placed in the Premises by Tenant, whether or not such trade fixtures or equipment are fastened to the Building; Tenant will not remove any trade fixtures or equipment without Landlord's prior written consent if such fixtures or equipment are used in the operation of the Building, or if the removal of such fixture or equipment will result in impairing the structural strength of the Building. Whether or not Tenant is in default, Tenant will remove such alterations, additions, improvements, trade fixtures, equipment and furniture as Landlord has requested in accordance with Article 15. above. Tenant will fully repair any damage occasioned by the removal of any trade fixtures, equipment, furniture, alterations, additions and improvements. All trade fixtures, equipment, furniture inventory, effects, alterations, additions, and improvements on the Premises after the end of the Term will be deemed conclusively to have been abandoned and may be appropriated, sold, stored, destroyed or otherwise disposed of by Landlord without notice to Tenant or any other person and without obligation to account for them; and Tenant will pay Landlord for all expenses incurred in connection with the removal of such property, including, but not limited to, the cost of repairing any damage to the Building or Premises caused by the removal of such property. Tenant's obligation to observe and perform this covenant will survive the expiration or other termination of this Lease.
ARTICLE 18. EMINENT DOMAIN
     If all the Premises are taken by exercise of the power of eminent domain (or conveyed by Landlord in lieu of such exercise) this Lease will terminate on a date (the "termination date") which is the earlier of the date upon which the condemning authority takes possession of the Premises or the date on which title to the Premises is vested in the condemning authority. If more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Rentable Area of the Premises is so taken, or if the Tenant does not cancel this Lease according to the preceding sentence, the Monthly Rent will be abated in the proportion of the Rentable Area of the Premises so taken to the Rentable Area of the Premises immediately before such taking, and Tenant's Share will be appropriately recalculated, If all or substantially all of the Building or the Project is so taken, Landlord may cancel this Lease by written notice to Tenant given thirty (30) days after the termination date. In the event of any such taking, the entire award will be paid to Landlord and Tenant will have no right or claim to any part of such award; however, Tenant will have the right to assert a claim against the condemning authority in a separate action and so long as Landlord's award is not reduced by such claim: for (i) Tenant's moving expenses; (ii) leasehold improvements owned by Tenant; (iii) any other award established solely for the benefit of Tenant.
ARTICLE 19. DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION
     If the Premises or the Building are damaged by fire or other insured casualty, Landlord will give Tenant notice of the time which will be needed to repair such damage, as determined by Landlord in its sole discretion, and the election (if any) which Landlord has made according to this Article 19. Such notice will be given before the forty-fifth (45th) day (the "Notice Date") after the fire or other insured casualty. If more than 25% of the rentable area is damaged as to be unrentable, then Tenant may cancel Lease.
     (a) If the Premises or the Building are damaged by fire or other insured casualty to an extent which may be repaired within ninety (90) days after the commencement of repair, as determined by Landlord, Landlord will begin to repair the damage within ninety (90) days after the notice date and will diligently pursue the completion of such repair. In such event, this Lease will continue in full force and effect except that Monthly Rent will be abated on a pro rata basis from the date of
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials 
13

 
the fire or other insured casualty until the date of the completion of such repairs (the "repair period") based on the Rentable Area of the portion of the Premises the use of which Tenant is deprived of during the repair period.
     (b) If the Premises or the Building are damaged by fire or other insured casualty to an extent which may not be repaired within ninety (90) days after the commencement of repair, but may be repaired within one hundred eighty (180) days after the commencement of repair, as determined by Landlord, then, at Landlord's option, Landlord will diligently pursue to repair such damage within one hundred eight (180) days after the notice date. If Landlord elects to repair such damage, Monthly Rent will be abated on a pro rata basis during the repair period based on the Rentable Area of the portion of the Premises the use of which Tenant is deprived during the repair period. If Landlord does not elect to repair such damage, this Lease will terminate on the notice date.
     (c) If the Premises or the Building are damaged by fire or other insured casualty to an extent which may not be repaired within one hundred eighty (180) days after the commencement of repair, as determined by Landlord, then (i) Landlord may cancel this Lease as of the date of such damage by written notice given to Tenant on or before the notice date or (ii) Tenant may cancel this Lease as of the date of such damage by written notice given to Landlord within ten (10) days after Landlord's delivery of a notice that the repairs cannot be made within such one hundred eighty (180) day period. If neither Landlord nor Tenant so elects to cancel this Lease, Landlord will repair the Building and Premises and Monthly Rent will be abated on a pro rata basis during the repair period based on the Rentable Area of the portion of the Premises the use of which Tenant is deprived during the repair period.
     (d) If the proceeds of insurance are insufficient to pay for the repair of any damage to the Premises or the Building, Landlord will have the option to repair such damage or cancel this Lease as of the date of such casualty by written notice to Tenant on or before the notice date. If any such damage by fire or other casualty is the result of the willful conduct or negligence or failure to act of Tenant, its agent, contractors, employees, or invitees, there will be no abatement of Monthly Rent as otherwise provided for in this Article 19.
Tenant waives any rights conferred by statute or otherwise on account of any damage to the Premises, the Building, or the Project, to the extent that those rights are inconsistent with Tenant's rights under this Article 19.
ARTICLE 20. SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT
20.1 General. This Lease and Tenant's rights under this Lease are subject and subordinate to any ground or underlying lease, first mortgage, indenture, first deed of trust or other first lien encumbrance, together with any renewals, extensions, modifications, consolidations and replacements of such first lien encumbrance, now or after the Date affecting or placed, charged or enforced against the Land, the Building, or all or any portion of the Project or any interest of Landlord in them or Landlord's interest in this Lease and the leasehold estate created by this Lease (except to the extent any such instrument will expressly provide that this Lease is superior to such instrument). This provision will be self-operative and no further instrument of subordination will be required in order to effect it. Nevertheless, Tenant will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord, at any time and from time to time, upon demand by Landlord, such documents as may be requested by Landlord, any ground or underlying lessor or any mortgagee, to confirm or effect any such subordination. If Tenant fails or refuses to execute, acknowledge and deliver any such document within twenty (20) days after written demand, Landlord, its successors and assigns will be entitled to execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such documents for and on behalf of Tenant as attorney-in-fact for Tenant. Tenant by this Section 20.1 constitutes and irrevocably appoints Landlord, its successors and assigns as Tenant's attorney-in-fact to execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all documents described in this Section 20.1 for and on behalf of Tenant, as provided in this Section 20.1.
20.2 Attornment. Tenant agrees that in the event that any holder of any ground or underlying lease, mortgage, deed of trust, or other encumbrance encumbering any part of the Project succeeds to landlord's interest in the Premises, Tenant will pay to such holder all rents subsequently payable under this Lease. Further, Tenant agrees that in the event of the enforcement by the trustee or the beneficiary under or holder or owner of any such mortgage, deed of trust, land or ground lease, Tenant will, upon request of any person or party succeeding to the interest of Landlord as a result of such enforcement, automatically become the Tenant of and attorn to such successor in interest without change in the term or provisions of this Lease. Such successor in interest will not be bound by (i) any payment of Monthly Rent or Rent for more than one month in advance except prepayments in the nature of security for the performance by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease, or (ii) any amendment or modification of this Lease made without the written consent or such trustee, beneficiary, holder or owner or such successor in interest. Upon request by such successor in interest and without cost to Landlord or such successor in interest Tenant will execute, acknowledge and deliver an instrument or instruments confirming the attornment. If Tenant fails or refuses to execute, acknowledge and deliver any such document within twenty (20) days after written demand, such successor in interest will be entitled to execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such documents for and on behalf of Tenant as attorney-in-fact for Tenant, and in such event, Tenant by this Section 20.2 constitutes and irrevocably appoints such successor in interest as Tenant's attorney-in-fact to execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all documents described in this Section 20.2 for and on behalf of Tenant, as provided in this Section 20.2.

Landlord will at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all of the doors in, on or about the Premises (excluding Tenant's vaults, safes and similar areas designated in writing by Tenant in advance). Landlord will have the right to use any and all means which Landlord may deem proper to open doors in and to the Premises in an emergency in order to obtain entry to the Premises. Any entry to the Premises obtained by Landlord by any means permitted under this Article 21 will not under any circumstances be construed or deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into or a detainer of the Premises or an eviction, actual or constructive, of Tenant from the Premises, or any portion of the Premises, nor will any such entry entitle Tenant to damages or an abatement of Monthly Rent, Additional Rent, or other charges which this Lease requires tenant to pay.
ARTICLE 22, INDEMNIFICATION, WAIVER AND RELEASE
22.1 Indemnification. Tenant will neither hold nor attempt to hold Landlord or its employees or agents liable for, and Tenant will indemnify and hold harmless Landlord, its employees and agents from and against, any and all demands, claims, causes of action, fines, penalties, damages (including consequential damages), liabilities, judgments, and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with or arising from:
     (a) the use or occupancy or manner of use or occupancy of the Premises by Tenant or any person claiming under Tenant;
     (b) any activity, work or thing done, permitted or offered by Tenant in or about the Premises or the Project;
     (c) any acts, omissions or negligence of Tenant or any person claiming under Tenant, or the contractors, agents, employees, invitees or visitors of Tenant or any such person;
     (d) any breach, violation or nonperformance by Tenant or any person claiming under Tenant or the employees agents, contractors, invitees or visitors of Tenant or any such person or any term, covenant or provision of this Lease of any law, ordinance or governmental requirement of any kind; or
     (e) any injury or damage to the person, property or business of Tenant, its employees, agents, contractors, invitees, visitors or any other person entering upon the Premises or the Project under the express or implied invitation of Tenant except for any injury or damage to persons or property on the Premises which is proximately caused by or results proximately from the negligence or deliberate act of Landlord or its employees.
     If any action of proceeding is brought against Landlord or its employees by reason of any such claim for which Tenant has indemnified Landlord, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord, will defend the same at Tenant's expense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.
22.2 Waiver and Release. Tenant, as a material part of the consideration to Landlord for this Lease, by this Section 22.2,waives and releases all claims against Landlord, its employees and agents with respect to all matters for which Landlord has disclaimed liability pursuant to the provisions of this Lease. Except for any damage or injury to person or property on the Premises, which is proximately caused by or results proximately from the negligence or deliberate act of Landlord or its employee, Tenant covenants and agrees that Landlord and its employees will not at any time or to any extent whatsoever be liable, responsible, or in any way accountable for any loss, injury, death or damage (including consequential damages) to persons, property or Tenant's business occasioned by any acts or omissions of any other Tenant, occupant or visitor of the Project, or from any cause, either ordinary or extraordinary, beyond Landlord's control.
ARTICLE 23. SECURITY DEPOSIT
Tenant has deposited the Security Deposit with Landlord as security for the full, faithful and timely performance of every provision of the Lease to be performed by Tenant. If Tenant defaults with respect to any provision of this Lease, including but not limited to the provisions relating to the payment of Rent, Landlord may use, apply or retain all or any part of the Security Deposit for the payment of any Rent, or any other sum in default, or for the payment of any other amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of Tenant's default, or to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage which Landlord may suffer by reason of Tenant's default. If any portion of the Security Deposit is so used, applied, or retained, Tenant will, within five (5) days after written demand, deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount. Landlord will not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general funds and Tenant will not be entitled to interest on the Security Deposit. The Security Deposit will not be deemed a limitation on Landlord's damages or a payment of liquidated damages or a payment of the Monthly Rent due for the last month of Term. If Tenant fully, faithfully and timely performs every provision of this Lease to be performed by it, the Security Deposit or any balance of the Security Deposit will be returned to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the term. Landlord may deliver the funds deposited under this Lease by Tenant to the purchaser of the Building

in the event the Building is sold, and after such time, Landlord will have no further liability to Tenant with respect to the Security Deposit.
ARTICLE 24. QUIET ENJOYMENT
Landlord covenants and agrees with Tenant that so long as Tenant pays the Rent, and observes and performs all the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease on Tenant's part to be observed and performed, Tenant may peacefully and quietly enjoy the Premises subject, nevertheless, to the terms and conditions of this Lease and Tenant's possession will not be disturbed by anyone claiming by, through or under Landlord.
ARTICLE 25. EFFECT OF SALE
A sale, conveyance or assignment of the Building or the Project which includes an assumption of Landlord's obligations to Tenant hereunder, will operate to release Landlord from liability from and after the effective date of such sale, conveyance or assignment upon all of the covenants, terms and conditions of this Lease, express or implied, except those liabilities which arose prior to such effective date, and after the effective date of such sale, conveyance or assignment, Tenant will look solely to Landlord's successor in interest in and to this Lease. This Lease will not be affected by any such sale, conveyance or assignment, and Tenant will attorn to Landlord's successor in interest to this Lease.
ARTICLE 26. DEFAULT
26.1 Events of Default. The following events are referred to collectively as "Events of Default," or individually, as an "Event of Default":
     (a) Tenant defaults in the due and punctual payment of Rent, and such default continues for five (5) days after written notice from Landlord; however, Tenant will not be entitled to more than one (1) notice for monetary defaults during any twelve (12) month period, and if, after such notice, any Rent is not paid when due, an Event of Default will be considered to have occurred without further notice.
     (b) Tenant vacates or abandons the Premises;
     (c) This Lease or the Premises or any part of the Premises are taken upon execution or by other process of law directed against Tenant, or are taken upon subject to any attachment at the instance for any creditor or claimant against Tenant, and said attachment is not discharged or disposed of within fifteen (15) days after its levy;
     (d) Tenant files a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or for reorganization or arrangement under the bankruptcy law or insolvency act of any-state, or admits the material allegations of any such petition by answer or otherwise, or is dissolved or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;
     (e) Involuntary proceedings under any such bankruptcy law or insolvency act or for the dissolution of Tenant are instituted against Tenant, or a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or substantially all of the property of Tenant, and such proceedings is not dismissed or such receivership or trusteeship vacated within sixty (60) days after such institution or appointment;
     (f) Tenant fails to take possession of the Premises on the Commencement Date of the Term; or
     (g) Tenant breaches any of the other agreements, terms, covenants or conditions which this Lease requires Tenant to perform, and such breach continues for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice from Landlord to Tenant; or if such breach cannot be cured reasonably within such thirty (30) day period and Tenant fails to commence to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after notice from Landlord or fails to proceed diligently to cure such breach within a reasonable time period thereafter.
     26.2 Landlord's Remedies. If any one or more Events of Default set forth in Section 26.1 above, occurs, then Landlord has the right, at its election;
     (a) to give Tenant written notice of Landlord's intention to terminate this Lease on the earliest date permitted by law or on any later date specified in such notice, in which case Tenant's right to possession of the Premises will cease and this Lease will be terminated, except as to Tenant's liability, as if the expiration of the term fixed in such notice were the end of the Term; or
     (b) without further demand or notice, to re-enter and take possession of the Premises or any part of the Premises, repossess the same, expel Tenant and those claiming through or under Tenant, and remove the effects of both or either, using such force for such purposes as may be necessary, without being liable for prosecution, without being deemed guilty of any manner of trespass, and without prejudice to any remedies for arrears of Monthly Rent or other amounts payable under this Lease or as a result of any proceeding breach of covenants or conditions; or
     (c) without further demand or notice to cure any Event of Default and to charge Tenant for the cost of effecting such cure, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and interest on the amount so advanced at the rate set forth in Section 28.21, below, provided that Landlord will have no obligation to cure any such Event of Default of Tenant. Should Landlord elect to reenter as provided in subsection (b), above, or should Landlord take possession pursuant to any notice provided by law, Landlord may from time to time, without terminating this Lease, re-let the Premises or any part of the Premises in Landlord's or Tenant's name, but for the account of Tenant, for such term or terms (which may be greater or less than the period which would otherwise have constituted the balance of the Term) and on such conditions and upon such other terms
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials 
16

 
(which may include concessions of free rent and alteration and repair of the Premises) as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may determine and Landlord may collect and receive the Rent. Landlord will in no way be responsible or liable for any failure to re-let the Premises, or any part of the Premises, for any failure to collect any Rent due upon such re-letting. No such re-entry or taking possession of the Premises by Landlord will be construed as an election on Landlord's part to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of such intention is given to Tenant. No notice from Landlord under this Section or under a forcible or unlawful entry and detainer statute or similar law will constitute an election by Landlord to terminate this Lease unless such notice specifically so states. Landlord Reserves the right following any such re-entry or re-letting to exercise its right to terminate this Lease by giving Tenant Such written notice, in which event this Lease will terminate as specified in such notice.
26.3 Certain Damages. In the event that Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as permitted in Section 26.2(a) above, but on the contrary, elects to take possession as provided in Section 26.2(b), above, Tenant will pay to Landlord: (i) Monthly Rent and other sums as provided in this Lease, which would be payable under this Lease if such repossession had not occurred, less; (ii) the net proceeds, if any, of any re-letting of the Premises after deducting all of Landlord's reasonable expenses in connection with such re-letting, including, without limitation, all repossession costs, brokerage commissions, attorneys' fees, expenses of employees, alteration and repair costs and expenses of preparation for such re-letting. If, in connection with any re-letting, the new lease term extends beyond the existing Term, or the premises covered by such new lease, include other premises not part of the Premises, a fair apportionment of the rent received for such re-letting and the expenses incurred in connection with such re-letting as provided in this Section will be made in determining the net proceeds from such re-letting, and any rent concessions will be equally apportioned over the term of the new lease. Tenant will pay such rent and other sums to Landlord monthly on the day which the Monthly Rent would have been payable under this Lease if possession had not been retaken and Landlord will be entitled to receive such rent and other sums from Tenant on each such day.
26.4 Continuing Liability After Termination. If this Lease is terminated on account of the occurrence of an Event of Default, Tenant will remain liable to Landlord for damages in an amount equal to Monthly Rent and other amounts which would have been owing by Tenant for the balance of the Term, had this Lease not been terminated, less the net proceeds, if any, of any re-letting of the Premises by Landlord subsequent to such termination, after deducting all of Landlord's expenses in connection with such re-letting, including, but without limitation, the expenses enumerated in Section 26.3, above. Landlord will be entitled to collect such damages from Tenant monthly on the day on which Monthly Rent and other amounts would have been payable under this Lease if this Lease had not been terminated, and Landlord will be entitled to receive such Monthly Rent and other amounts from Tenant on each such day. Alternatively, at the option of Landlord, in the event this Lease is so terminated, Landlord will be entitled to recover against Tenant as damages for losses of the bargain and not as a penalty:
     (i) the worth at the time of award of the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination;
     (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided;
     (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term of this Lease (had the same not ben so terminated by Landlord) after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided or,
     (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.
     "The worth at the time of award" of the amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii), above, is computed by adding interest at the per annum interest rate described in Section 28.21, below, on the date on which this Lease is terminated from the date of termination until the time of award. "The worth at the time of award" of the amount referred to in clause (iii), above, is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of Denver at the time of award plus one percent (1%).
26.5 Cumulative Remedies. Any suit or suits for recovery of the amounts and damages set forth in Sections 26.3 and 26.4, above, may be brought by Landlord, from time to time, at Landlord's election, and nothing in this Lease will be deemed to require Landlord to await the date upon which this Lease or the term would have expired had there occurred no Event of Default. Each right and remedy provided for in this Lease is cumulative and is in addition to every other right or remedy provided for in this Lease or now or after the Date existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Landlord of any one or more of the rights or remedies provided for in this Lease or now or after the Date existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorney's fees (including those of in-house counsel) and costs whether or not suit is brought.
26.6 Waiver of Redemption. Tenant waives any right of redemption arising as a result of Landlord's exercise of its remedies under this Article 26.
ARTICLE 27. PARKING
See First Addendum
ARTICLE 28. MISCELLANEOUS
28.1 No Offer. This Lease is submitted to Tenant on the understanding that it will not be considered an offer and will not
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials 
17

 
bind Landlord in any way until (a) Tenant has duly executed and delivered duplicate originals to Landlord and (b) Landlord has executed and delivered one of such originals to Tenant.
28.2 Joint and Several Liability. If Tenant is composed of more than one signatory to this Lease, each signatory will be jointly and severally liable with each other signatory for payment and performance according to this Lease. The act of, notice to, notice from, refund to, or signature of, any signatory to this Lease (including without limitation modifications of this Lease made by fewer than all such signatories) will bind every other signatory as though every other signature had so acted, or received or given the notice or refund, or signed.
28.3 No Construction Against Drafting Party. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge that each of them and their counsel have had an opportunity to review this Lease and that this Lease will not be construed against Landlord merely because Landlord has prepared it.
28.4 Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of each and every provision of this Lease.
28.5 No Recordation. Tenant's recordation of this Lease or any memorandum or short form of it will be void and a default under this Lease.
28.6 No Waiver. The waiver by either party of any agreement, condition or provision contained in this Lease will not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other agreement, condition or provision contained in this Lease, nor will any custom or practice which may grow up between the parties in the administration of the terms of this Lease be construed to waive or to lessen the right of either party to insist upon the performance by the other party in strict accordance with the terms of this Lease. The subsequent acceptance of Rent by Landlord will not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any agreement, condition, or provision of this Lease, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular Rent so accepted, regardless of Landlord's knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent.
28.7 Estoppel Certificate. At any time and from time to time, but within ten (10) days after prior written request by Landlord, Tenant will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord, promptly upon request, a certificate certifying (a) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect or, if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full force and effect, as modified, and stating the date and nature of each modification, (b) the date, if any to which rent and other sums payable under this Lease have been paid, (c) that no notice of any default has been delivered to Landlord which default has not been cured, except as to defaults specified in said certificate, and (d) such other matters as may be reasonably requested by Landlord. Any such certificate may be relied upon by any prospective purchaser or existing or prospective mortgagee or beneficiary under any deed of trust on the building or any part of the Project. Tenant's failure to deliver such a certificate within such time will be conclusive evidence of the matters set forth in it.
28.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. Landlord and Tenant by this Section 28.8, waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim brought by either of the parties to this Lease against the other on any matters whatsoever arising out of or in anyway connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, Tenant's use of occupancy of the Premises, or any other claims (except claims for personal injury or property damage), and any emergency statutory or any other statutory remedy.
28.9 No Merger. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant or the cancellation of this Lease by mutual agreement of Tenant and Landlord or the termination of this Lease on account of Tenant's default will not work a merger, and will, at Landlord's option, (a) terminate all or any subleases and subtenancies or (b) operate as an assignment to Landlord of all or any subleases or subtenancies. Landlord's option under this Section 28.9 will be exercised by notice to Tenant and all known sublessees or subtenants in the Premises or any part of the Premises.
28.10 Holding Over. Tenant will have no right to remain in possession of all or any part of the Premises after the expiration of the Term. If Tenant remains in possession of all or any part of the Premises after the expiration of the Term, with the express or implied consent of Landlord: (a) such tenancy will be deemed to be a periodic tenancy from month-to-month only; (b) such tenancy will not constitute a renewal or extension of this Lease for any further term; and (c) such tenancy may be terminated by Landlord upon the earliest of (i) thirty (30) days' prior written notice or (ii) the earliest date permitted by law. In such event, Monthly Rent will be increased to an amount equal to 125% of the Monthly Rent payable during the last month of the Term, and any other sums due under this Lease will be payable in the amount and at the times specified in this Lease. Such month-to-month tenancy will be subject to every other term, condition, and covenant contained in this Lease.
28.11 Notices. Any notice, request, demand, consent, approval or other communications required or permitted under this Lease must be in writing and will be deemed to have been given when personally delivered or deposited in any depository regularly maintained by the United States Postal Service, postage prepaid, certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the party for whom it is intended at its address set forth in Article 1, above. Either Landlord or Tenant may add additional addresses or change its address for purposes of receipt of any such communication by giving ten (10) days' prior written notice of such change to the other party in the manner prescribed in this Section 28.11.
28.12 Severability. If any provision of this Lease proves to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease will not be affected by such finding, and in lieu of each provision of this Lease that is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, a provision will be added as a part of this Lease as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and be legal, valid and enforceable.
28.13 Written Amendment Required. No amendment, alteration, modification of or addition to the Lease will be valid or binding unless expressed in writing and signed by Landlord and Tenant. Tenant agrees to make any modifications of the terms and provisions of this Lease required or requested by any lending institution providing financing for the Building, or
   Landlord's Initials Tenant's Initials

Project, as the case may be, provided: that no such modifications will materially adversely affect Tenant's rights and obligations under this Lease.
28.14 Entire Agreement. This Lease, the Exhibits and Addenda, if any, contain the entire agreement between Landlord and Tenant. No promises or representations, except as contained in this Lease, have been made to Tenant respecting the condition or the manner of operating the Premises, the Building, or the Project.
28.15 Captions. The captions of the various Articles and Sections of this Lease are for convenience only and do not necessarily define, limit, describe or construe the contents of such Articles or Sections.
28.16 Notice of Landlord's Default. In the event of any alleged default in the obligation of Landlord under this Lease, Tenant will deliver to Landlord written notice listing the reasons for Landlord's default and Landlord will have thirty (30)days following receipt of such notice to cure such alleged default or, in the event the alleged default cannot reasonably be cured within a thirty (30) day period, to commence action and proceed diligently to cure such alleged default. A copy of such notice to Landlord will be sent to any holder of a mortgage or other encumbrances on the Building or Project of which Tenant has been notified in writing, and any such holder will also have the same time periods to cure such alleged default.
28.17 Authority. Tenant and the party executing this Lease on behalf of Tenant represent to Landlord that such party is authorized to do so by requisite action of the Board of Directors, or partners, as the case may be, and agree upon request to deliver to Landlord a resolution or similar document to that effect.
28.18 Brokers. Landlord and Tenant respectively represent and warrant to each other that neither of them has consulted or negotiated with any broker or finder with regard to the Premises except the Broker names in Article 1, above, of any, (the "Broker"). Each of them will indemnify the other against and hold the other harmless from any claims for fees or commissions from anyone with whom either of them has consulted or negotiated with regard to the Premises except the Broker. Landlord will pay any fees or commission due the Broker.
28.19 Governing Law. This Lease will be governed by and construed pursuant to the laws of the State in which the Project is located.
28.20 Force Majeure. Landlord will have no liability to Tenant nor will Tenant have any right to terminate this Lease or abate Rent or assert a claim of partial or total actual or constructive eviction, because of Landlord's failure to perform any of its obligations in the Lease if the failure is due to reasons beyond Landlord's reasonable control, including without limitation, strikes or other labor difficulties, inability to obtain necessary governmental permits and approvals (including scarcity of materials, war, riot, civil insurrection, accidents, acts of God and governmental preemption in connection with a national emergency.

In addition, any Rent which is not paid when due, including Monthly Rent, will accrue interest at a late rate charge of the Prime Rate plus five percent (5%) per annum (but in no event in an amount in excess of the maximum rate allowed by applicable law) from the date on which it was due until the date on which it is paid in full with accrued interest.
28.22 No Easements for Air or Light. Any diminution or shutting off of light, air or view by any structure which may be erected on lands adjacent to the Building will in no way affect this Lease or impose any liability on Landlord.

Unless otherwise set forth herein, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Office Lease and First Addendum.
RECITALS:
          WHEREAS, on November 22, 2004, Landlord and Tenant entered into an Office Lease (the "Lease") concerning 39,378 square feet on the second floor of the Building (the "Original Premises"); and
          WHEREAS, on November 23, 2004, Landlord and Tenant executed the First Addendum to Office Lease ("First Addendum"); and
          WHEREAS, Tenant desires to lease the Additional Premises (10,642 square feet); and
          WHEREAS, Tenant desires additional parking spaces at the Building; and
          WHEREAS, Landlord is willing to lease additional parking spaces to the Tenant, subject to the Landlord's right to cancel Tenant's parking privileges for the additional parking spaces, as set forth below; and
          WHEREAS, in order to satisfy the Tenant's parking requirement, Landlord will be required to construct additional parking at the Building,
 

 
          NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Landlord and Tenant agree as follows:
          1. Recitals. The Recitals set forth above are incorporated herein by this reference.
          2. Revised Commencement Date. Tenant shall take possession of the Additional Premises within five (5) days after Landlord and Tenant mutually determine in good faith that the tenant improvements have been substantially completed and the Additional Premises is ready for occupancy, but in no event later than five (5) days after the Certificate of Occupancy for the Additional Premises is received by Landlord (the "Revised Commencement Date"). Upon taking possession, Tenant shall sign an acknowledgment, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A", acknowledging the Revised Commencement Date.
          3. Term. The term for the Additional Premises shall be forty eight (48) months, beginning on the first day of the first full month after the Revised Commencement Date and ending on the last day of the forty eighth (48th) month after the Revised Commencement Date ("Revised Expiration Date"); provided, however, in no event shall the Revised Commencement Date be earlier than May 31, 2010. The term for the Original Premises is extended to the Revised Expiration Date.

          5. Parking.
               (a) Landlord shall provide to Tenant 287 parking spaces (the "Base Parking Spaces") during the term of the Lease and any extension, representing 246 parking spaces for the Original Premises and 41 parking spaces for the Additional Premises;
               (b) In addition to the Base Parking Spaces, beginning on the day following the completion of the Additional Parking and through the Revised Expiration Date, and during any extension of the Lease, Tenant shall lease an additional 170 parking spaces (the "Additional Parking") at the rate of $4,675.00 per month (the "Parking Expense"), subject to Landlord's right to cancel some or all of the Additional Parking. In the event the Landlord elects to cancel some or all of the Additional Parking, Landlord shall give Tenant a written notice (the "Recapture Notice") stating the number of parking spaces that are subject to the Recapture Notice (the "Recaptured Parking"). The Recapture Notice shall be effective ninety (90) days after the date of the Recapture Notice. Landlord shall not be limited in the number of Cancellation Notices it may deliver to the Tenant, but in no event may the total Recaptured Parking exceed the Additional Parking. In the event the Recaptured Parking, or any portion thereof, is no longer needed by Landlord, it shall be made available to the Tenant, at the rate of $27.50 per month per parking space. In the event the Recaptured Parking, or any portion thereof, is no longer needed by Landlord, it shall be re-leased by Tenant, if Tenant elects, at the rate of $27.50 per month per space up to, but not including, the effective date of each Cancellation Notice. Landlord shall give Tenant no less than thirty (30) day's prior written notice when the Recaptured Parking, or any portion thereof, will be available to Tenant. The Parking
3

 
Expense shall be payable by the Tenant to the Landlord with the Monthly Base Rent and Additional Rent. Landlord and Tenant agree that no commissions to any Broker will be due for the Parking Expense set forth herein.
                    (c) Landlord shall commence with construction of the Additional Parking within ten (10) days of the full execution of this Second Addendum.
          6. Additional Rent. In addition to the Monthly Rent, as set forth on. Exhibit "B" and the Parking Expense, Tenant agrees to pay the following as Additional Rent: (i) all rent tax ; (ii) all electricity and water charges and expenses directly associated with Tenant's occupancy of the Additional Premises and the Original Premises (the "Agreed Expenses"); (iii) an excise fee equal to four percent (4%) of the Agreed Expenses; (iv) a management fee equal to four percent (4%) of the Monthly Base Rent for the Additional Premises, (v) any Overage Amount, as set forth in Section 7 below; and (vi) a portion of Landlord's Operating Expenses for the Building, as set forth in subsection (b) below. The Agreed Expenses shall equal to amount obtained by, using the applicable month from 2002, (x) subtracting the 2002 applicable month's kilowatt hours or gallons, as applicable, used from the current month's kilowatt hours or gallons used, (y) dividing the difference by the current month's kilowatt hours or gallons used, and (z) multiplying that fraction by the total bill for the current month that exceeds the total Operating Expenses of the Building for the base year (the "Additional Costs"). The "Additional Rent" shall be due on a monthly basis and shall be paid to Landlord with the Monthly Base Rent and Parking Expense.
     (b) Except as set forth in this Section 6, in connection with the Original Premises and the Additional Premises, Tenant agrees to pay 27.18% of Landlord's Operating Expenses over the base year expenses, using 2005 as the base year. For purposes of this subsection (b),
4

 
Landlord's Operating Expenses shall include all expenses associated with the operation of the Building, but not include the Agreed Expenses or the management fee set forth in subsection (a) above.
     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Addendum, the Lease or the First Addendum, in the event that Tenant's Agreed Expenses increase by more than five percent (5%) from the previous month and an additional tenant has either begun occupancy or increased occupancy in the Building, then Tenant shall have the right to require that Landlord bills such additional tenant for the increase (the "New Tenant Cost"). Tenant shall have no obligation to pay the New Tenant Cost to Landlord. The New Tenant Cost shall be calculated by (i) obtaining the average of the same expense or charge from, as applicable, either the previous three (3) months or, if after December 31, 2007, then the previous six (6) months (the "Old Cost") and (ii) subtracting that average from the current month's charge. The difference shall be the New Tenant Cost. Such additional tenant shall continue to pay the New Tenant Cost until the increase between the Old Cost and the New Tenant Cost is less than five percent (5%).
     (d) Currently, Landlord is responsible for trash removal, which occurs two (2) times per week. In the event that trash accumulation requires Landlord to increase removal to three (3) times per week, then Tenant shall be responsible for the additional costs associated solely with the additional removal per week, provided such costs are disclosed and approved by Tenant, in Tenant's reasonable discretion. In the event an additional tenant has either begun occupancy or increased occupancy in the Building, then Tenant and such additional tenant shall ratably share the additional trash removal costs, in accordance with the total square footage of their premises.
          7. Tenant's Improvement Allowance. Landlord agrees to pay no more than twenty five dollars ($25.00) per rentable square foot for tenant improvements in the
5

 
Additional Premises, for a total improvement allowance of $266,050.00 (the "Additional Total Improvement Allowance"). In the event the tenant improvements for the Additional Premises exceed the Additional Total Improvement Allowance, Landlord will advance the costs for such improvements, but in no event in an amount greater than a total of $30.00 per square foot (the "Overage Amount"). The Overage Amount will be due from Tenant and paid, at the election of Tenant: (i) within thirty (30) days after notice from Landlord of the Overage Amount, or (ii) by Landlord amortizing the Overage Amount over the remaining term of the Lease, plus 8%, and be payable monthly by Tenant with the Monthly Rent. The cost of any tenant improvements that exceeds a total of $30.00 per square foot shall be the sole responsibility of the Tenant. Any unused portion of the Additional Total Improvement Allowance shall be credited to Tenant in the from of rent abatement, based on the following schedule: twenty five percent (25%) of the unused portion of the Additional Total Improvement Allowance shall be credited to Tenant on the one, two, three and four year anniversary of the Revised Commencement Date, respectively.
          8. Second Floor Bathrooms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Second Addendum, the Lease or the First Addendum, Tenant shall be responsible for the cleaning and stocking of the one (1) men's and one (1) women's bathrooms located on the second floor of the Building and located outside of the Original Premises. In the event that Tenant's costs increase by more than five percent (5%) and an additional tenant has either begun occupancy or increased occupancy, then the calculations contained in Section 6(c) shall be used to calculate such tenant's costs, as set forth in Section 6(c).
          9. Option to Renew. Tenant shall have one (1) three (3) year option to renew at the following rates:
          June 1, 2010:                     $1.18 per square foot per month ($59,023.60)
6

 
          June 1, 2011:                      $1.21 per square foot per month ($60,524.20)
          June 1, 2012:                     $1.24 per square foot per month ($62,024.80)
          In order to exercise this option, Tenant must provide written notice to Landlord no earlier than one year and no later than 180 days prior to the Revised Expiration Date. This option shall apply only if Tenant exercises its right renew for both the Original Premises and Additional Premises.
