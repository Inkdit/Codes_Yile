GOVERNANCE
　　　　　SECTION 2.01. Agreement to Vote.

　　　　　SECTION 2.02. Size and Composition of Board. (a) At any time following (but not prior to) the Full Option Exercise and prior to the consummation of an Investor Exit Event, Investor shall be entitled to appoint a number of Directors (the "Investor Directors") in proportion to the percentage of the Fully-Diluted Equity held by Investor, such number of Directors to be rounded down to the closest integer but to be no fewer than one Director (the "Board Representation Rights"); provided that following the consummation of a Qualified IPO, the Board Representation Rights shall be effected through a voting agreement to be entered into between Parent and Investor prior to the consummation of such Qualified IPO (and not effected in the Articles of Association), which shall provide that: (i) out of the total number of non-independent Directors, Investor shall be entitled to appoint such number of non-independent Directors as is proportional to the percentage of the Fully-Diluted Equity held by Investor (such number of non-independent Directors to be rounded down to the closest integer but to be no fewer than one); and (ii) out of the total number of independent Directors, Investor shall be entitled to nominate such number of independent Director candidates as is proportional to the percentage of the Fully-Diluted Equity held by Investor (such number of candidates to be rounded down to the closest integer); provided, further, that in the case of each of the foregoing, (A) the number of non-independent Directors Investor is entitled to appoint shall be no fewer than one Director following a Full Option Exercise and prior to the consummation of an Investor Exit Event; and (B) for so long as Investor holds fewer Ordinary Shares (on an as-converted basis) than Parent, Investor shall not, under any circumstances under the Board Representation Rights, be entitled to nominate a greater number of Directors than Parent (but subject to Investor being entitled to appoint no fewer than one non-independent Director to the Board after the Full Option Exercise and prior to the consummation of an Investor Exit Event).
　　　　　(b) The rights of Investor set forth in Section 2.02(a) shall (i) survive and continue after the consummation of a Qualified IPO and (ii) terminate upon the consummation of an Investor Exit Event, provided, however, that notwithstanding the occurrence of an Investor Exit Event, the rights of the Investor under Section 2.02(a) may be assigned to any transferee to whom Investor transfers Acquired Shares in one or a series of related transactions within a three-month period so long as (i) such transferee is a Qualified New Investor and (ii) following such transfer, such Qualified New Investor holds and continues to hold at least 50% of the Acquired Shares (such assignment, a "Board Representation Assignment").

     (vi) any issuance of Securities, other than (A) at any time following April 29, 2014, issuances (whether in any one transaction or together with all other transactions) of Securities that represent, in the aggregate, no more than 15% of Fully-Diluted Equity; (B) on or prior to April 29, 2014, issuances (whether in any one transaction or together with all other transactions) of Securities that represent, in the aggregate, no more than 15% of Fully-Diluted Equity, provided that each such issuance is consummated at a price per Ordinary Share (on an as-converted basis) that is no lower than the highest price per Ordinary Share (on an as-converted basis) paid by Investor for the Acquired Shares (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, combinations, reclassifications, recapitalizations and the like) and the terms of each such issuance are not more favorable in any material respect to the purchaser(s) or subscriber(s) of such Securities than the terms of Investor's purchase of the Acquired Shares; (C) issuances of Securities pursuant to an equity-based incentive plan approved by the Relevant Board, including the Option Plan; (D) issuances of Securities on a pro rata basis in connection with any share splits, share dividends, combinations, reclassifications, recapitalizations, rights issuances and the like; (E) issuances of Securities to be offered in a Qualified IPO; (F) issuances of Securities upon the conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable Securities issued in accordance with this Agreement, pursuant to the terms of such Securities; or (G) Securities issued upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares;


13

     (vii) any establishment of, or amendment to, any equity-based incentive plan that would result (whether in any one transaction or together with all other transactions) in the Securities issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of the options and other equity awards authorized under all equity-based incentive plans of the Company (including the Option Plan and other existing equity-based incentive plans of the Company), in the aggregate, exceeding 43,750,000 Ordinary Shares (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, combinations, reclassifications, recapitalizations and the like);

provided, that in no event shall any of the foregoing be construed as requiring Parent, the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries to obtain the consent of Investor with respect to actions reasonably necessary to effect a Qualified IPO.
　　　　　(b) The Consent Matters set forth in subsections (i), (iv), (v), (viii) and (ix) above shall be referred to as the "Qualified Consent Matters".

The (i) issue and allotment by the Company to Investor of any Option Shares that are not Parent Option Shares, Redemption Option Shares or Employee Option Shares (the "Company Option Shares") and the Redemption Option Shares, (ii) transfer by Parent to Investor of the Parent Option Shares to Investor and/or (iii) transfer by the Option Employees to Investor of the Employee Option Shares (an "Option Closing") shall be completed as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within ninety (90) days after the date of the Option Notice at such time and place as may be reasonably agreed between Investor and the Company, provided that in the event that the Company has commenced a U.S. Qualified IPO, the Option Closing shall be completed contemporaneously with, and subject to, the consummation of such U.S. Qualified IPO and provided further that in the event that the exercise of any over-allotment option granted to any underwriters in connection with a Qualified IPO would increase the Full Option Exercise Amount, the Option Closing with respect to the Option Shares comprising such increase shall be completed contemporaneously with the consummation of the settlement of such over-allotment option.
　　　　　(b) In the event that Investor has delivered the Full Option Exercise Election, at least three (3) Business Days prior to each Option Closing, the Company shall determine the Full Option Exercise Amount (or if applicable in connection with the exercise of any over-allotment option granted to any underwriters in connection with a Qualified IPO, the increase in the Full Option Exercise Amount) in accordance with this Agreement and notify the Investor thereof. At least three (3) Business Days prior to each Option Closing, Investor shall deliver a notice to Parent and the Company setting forth the number or portion of Option Shares to be purchased by Investor and/or the Permitted Transferees of Investor and if applicable, name of each such Permitted Transferee. At each Option Closing, the Company and Parent shall, and Parent shall procure the Company to, deliver or cause to be delivered to Investor: (i) share certificates in the name of Investor and/or its Permitted Transferees representing the applicable Company Option Shares, Redemption Option Shares and/or Employee Option Shares, (ii) existing share certificates evidencing the Employee Option Shares or the Parent Option Shares, in each case, accompanied by relevant instruments of transfer duly executed in blank; (iii) a certified true copy of the Register of Members of the Company indicating that Investor and/or its Permitted Transferees are the registered holder of the applicable Option Shares; (iv) receipts for the aggregate Option Price for (A) the Company Option Shares, (B) the Parent Option Shares and (C) the Employee Option Shares and the Redemption Option Shares; and (v) a certificate of a duly authorized officer of the Company (the "Option Closing Certificate") certifying that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.05 are true and correct in all respects.


17

　　　　　(c) At each Option Closing, Investor shall deliver or cause to be delivered (i) to the Company, the aggregate Option Price for the Company Option Shares by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account to be designated by the Company in a written notice to Investor at least three (3) Business Days prior to the intended date of such Option Closing, (ii) to Parent, the aggregate Option Price for the Parent Option Shares by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account to be designated by Parent in a written notice to Investor at least three (3) Business Days prior to the intended date of such Option Closing and (iii) to Parent, the aggregate Option Price for the Redemption Option Shares and the Employee Option Shares by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account to be designated by Parent in a written notice to Investor at least three (3) Business Days prior to the intended date of such Option Closing.
　　　　　(d) Parent shall remit the portion of the aggregate Option Price to each Option Employee in respect of such portion of the Redemption Option Shares and/or Employee Option Shares, as applicable, sold by such Option Employee at such Option Closing net of any applicable withholding Taxes and any applicable exercise consideration and other costs and expenses payable by the relevant Option Employee. Investor shall not deduct or withhold Taxes in respect of the Option Price of the Employee Option Shares or the Redemption Option Shares, such withholding to be the sole responsibility of Parent.
　　　　　(e) Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the Company to effect a redemption and/or repurchase of such number of Ordinary Shares and/or options issued under the Option Plan from Option Employees, effective as of each Option Closing, equal to the total number of Redemption Option Shares to be issued in respect of such Option Closing, provided, however, that if any such redemption and/or repurchase shall not have been effected as of such Option Closing, then as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days following such Option Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to, effect a redemption and/or repurchase of Ordinary Shares and/or options issued under the Option Plan to Option Employees such that the total number of Ordinary Shares and/or options redeemed or repurchased as of such Option Closing and during such 30-day period shall equal the number of Redemption Option Shares issued in respect of such Option Closing (a "Post-Closing Redemption").
　　　　　(f) Following the delivery of the Option Notice, each of Parent, the Company and Investor shall use reasonable endeavors to perform all further acts and things, and execute and deliver such further documents as Investor may reasonably require or as may be required by Law to implement and/or give effect to the issuance, allotment and transfer contemplated under this Article III.

33

　　　　　(b) Suspension.
     (i) In the event that Parent reasonably determines in good faith that there has occurred any material breach by Alibaba of any agreement, undertaking or covenant set forth in Clause 4 of the Guarantee and Undertaking with respect to the obligations set forth in Section 4.03 (Restrictions on Sales or Pledges to Competitors), Section 4.05 (Right of First Offer) or Section 4.06 (Permitted Transferees) of this Agreement (other than for any breach of any requirements set forth in Section 4.05 that are primarily procedural in nature) (a "Material Breach"), including any Deemed Material Breach (as defined in Section 7.01(b)(ii)), Parent shall provide written notice thereof to Investor, which includes reasonable detail regarding such alleged Material Breach (the "Breach Notice"). If Investor has a reasonable basis for disputing in good faith whether such Material Breach has occurred, Investor may provide to Parent a written notice (a "Breach Dispute Notice") of such dispute (a "Dispute"), setting forth in reasonable detail such reasonable basis, within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the Breach Notice (the "Breach Notice Period").
     (ii) The parties agree and acknowledge that any breach by Alibaba of any agreement, undertaking or covenant set forth in Clause 4 of the Guarantee and Undertaking with respect to the obligations set forth in Section 4.06(d) shall be deemed to be material for purposes of this Section 7.01(b) (a "Deemed Material Breach").
     (iii) In the event that Investor fails to provide a Breach Dispute Notice to Parent within the Breach Notice Period, Investor shall be deemed to have acknowledged such Material Breach, in which case Parent and the Company shall be entitled, without any further obligations on the part of Parent or the Company under this Section 7.01, to terminate this Agreement effective as of the date of delivery by Parent of a written notice of such election to the other parties hereto (which notice shall be delivered by no later than seven (7) calendar days after the expiration of the Breach Notice Period).

If, following such good faith discussions, Parent reasonably concludes in good faith that Alibaba has committed a Material Breach and such Material Breach has not been cured within ten (10) Business Days following the end of the Breach Discussion Period (the "Cure Period"), Parent and the Company shall be entitled to, without any further obligations on the part of Parent or the Company under this Section 7.01, suspend this Agreement (including the rights and obligations of each party hereto hereunder, other than this Section 7.01(b), and Sections 4.06(c), 4.06(d), 4.07, 8.07 and 8.08) effective as of the date of the expiration of the Cure Period (which such election shall be notified to the other parties hereto by Parent as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Cure Period).

Investor may exercise its right under this Section 7.01(b)(v)by providing a notice in writing to Parent and the Company together with a certificate of a duly authorized officer of Investor certifying as to the matters set forth in this Section 7.01(b)(v).
     (vi) This Agreement shall terminate if it is determined (by agreement of the parties or pursuant to Section 8.08, but without giving effect to Section 8.08(e)) that there was a Material Breach by Alibaba.
     (vii) In the event that Parent and the Company shall have suspended this Agreement (including the rights and obligations of each party hereto hereunder) pursuant to this Section 7.01(b) and it is determined (by agreement of the parties or pursuant to Section 8.08, but without giving effect to Section 8.08(e)) that Alibaba did not commit a Material Breach or Alibaba has cured such breach, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Alibaba for any losses, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) suffered or incurred by Alibaba or any of its Affiliates arising out of or resulting from the suspension of this Agreement by Parent and the Company.

Upon the consummation of a Qualified IPO, the references to "thirty (30) days" set forth in Sections 4.05(d) and 4.05(e) shall thereafter be replaced by "three (3) Business Days".

　　　　　This AMENDMENT AGREEMENT, dated as of April 4, 2014, to the Amended and Restated Shareholders' Agreement, dated as of March 14, 2014 (the "Shareholders' Agreement"), by and among Ali WB Investment Holding Limited, an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("Investor"), SINA Corporation, an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("Parent"), and Weibo Corporation, an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the "Company"), is hereby entered into by Investor, Parent and the Company. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Shareholders' Agreement.
W I T N E S S E T H:
　　　　　WHEREAS, pursuant to the Option Exercise Notice, dated March 14, 2014, delivered by Investor to the Company and Parent, Investor validly elected the Full Option Exercise Election in accordance with the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement;
　　　　　WHEREAS, such Full Option Exercise Election was made by Investor after the Company had commenced a U.S. Qualified IPO, and accordingly, pursuant to Section 3.04 of the Shareholders' Agreement, the Option Closing in respect of such Full Option Exercise Election shall be completed contemporaneously with, and subject to, the consummation of such U.S. Qualified IPO (the "IPO Option Closing"); and
　　　　　WHEREAS, the parties seek to amend and modify certain provisions of the Shareholders' Agreement as set forth below in connection with the IPO Option Closing and the Option Shares to be acquired by Investor at the IPO Option Closing.
　　　　　NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
     1. Option Shares.
     (a) Notwithstanding the proviso in Section 3.01(a) of the Shareholders' Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that (i) 10% of the number of Option Shares to be acquired by Investor at the IPO Option Closing shall be in the form of Redemption Option Shares to be newly issued and allotted by the Company to Investor at the IPO Option Closing, (ii) 10% of the number of Option Shares to be acquired by Investor at the IPO Option Closing shall be in the form of shares of the Company to be newly issued and allotted to Investor in such U.S. Qualified IPO (the "Investor IPO Shares") at the IPO Option Closing and (iii) 80% of the number of Option Shares to be acquired by Investor at the IPO Option Closing shall be in the form of Parent Option Shares owned by Parent and to be transferred to Investor at the IPO Option Closing, in each case of (i) to (iii), based on the price as determined pursuant to Section 2 below.
     (b) For the avoidance of doubt, in accordance with the Shareholders' Agreement, the number of Option Shares to be acquired by Investor at the IPO Option Closing, when taken together with the Acquired Shares immediately prior to such issuance of the Option Shares, shall be equal to 30% of the Fully-Diluted Equity (after taking into account any applicable Post-Closing Redemption) immediately after such issuance of the Option Shares and after taking into account the Securities to be issued in such U.S. Qualified IPO (including the Investor IPO Shares and any Securities issued upon the exercise of any over-allotment option granted to any underwriters in connection with such U.S. Qualified IPO).

     2. Option Price. Notwithstanding Section 3.03(a) of the Shareholders' Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that (a) the Option Price with respect to the Option Shares to be acquired by Investor at the IPO Option Closing (except the Investor IPO Shares) shall be equal to an amount that represents a 15% discount to the offering price per Ordinary Share in such U.S. Qualified IPO and (b) the Option Price with respect to the Investor IPO Shares to be acquired by Investor at the IPO Option Closing shall be equal to the offering price per Ordinary Share in such U.S. Qualified IPO.
     3. Qualified IPO. Notwithstanding the definition of "Qualified IPO" as set forth in the Shareholders' Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that with respect to the initial public offering by the Company of which a proposed public offering price range of $17 to $19 per ADS and a proposed basic offering size of 20,000,000 ADSs will be set forth in the preliminary prospectus included in a registration statement on Form F-1 that will be filed with the SEC on or about April 4, 2014, the offering associated with such registration statement will be deemed to be a "Qualified IPO," if the offering is the first underwritten public offering of the Ordinary Shares on an internationally recognized securities exchange or automated quotation system (including any such securities exchange or automated quotation system in the U.S. or Hong Kong) that (a) results in issuances of Securities in such offering, including any Securities that may be issued upon the exercise of any over-allotment option granted to any underwriters, of no more than 15% of the Fully-Diluted Equity immediately after the consummation of such offering (giving effect to any applicable Post-Closing Redemption) and the issuance of the Option Shares; and (b) (i) in the event Investor has not effected a Qualified Option Exercise, with an offering price per Ordinary Share that results in the pre-money equity valuation of the Company implied in such public offering being in excess of 1.5 times the Initial Valuation and (ii) in the event Investor has effected a Qualified Option Exercise, with an offering price per Ordinary Share that is equal to or exceeds the Option Price (in each case, as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, combinations, reclassifications, recapitalizations and the like).
     4. No Other Amendments or Modifications. Except as expressly set forth herein, all provisions of the Shareholders' Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, including without limitation Parent's obligations to effect the Post-Closing Redemption as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days following the IPO Option Closing.
     5. Governing Law. This Amendment Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Hong Kong, without regard to the conflicts of laws rules stated therein.
     6. Counterparts. This Amendment Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile or other means of electronic transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
