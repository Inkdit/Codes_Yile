　　WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Merger, the PSS Parties own approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of ABI capital stock and desire that the Merger be completed pursuant to the Merger Agreement;
　　WHEREAS, as an inducement for the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, ABI has agreed that it is a condition to the Company's obligation to consummate the Merger that the PSS Parties execute and deliver this Agreement and thereby establish (a) certain terms and conditions concerning the voting of and future acquisitions of Company Common Stock by the PSS Parties and their respective Affiliates, and (b) certain other matters concerning the corporate governance of the Company; and
　　WHEREAS, certain terms used herein are defined in Article IV hereof.

　　(d) acquisitions of Company Common Stock that would not cause the PSS Parties and their respective Affiliates collectively to Beneficially Own more than 83.5% of the then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; and
　　(e) acquisitions of Company Common Stock pursuant to, or after the consummation of, a Qualifying Tender Offer.
ARTICLE II

　　SECTION 2.05 No Circumvention. No PSS Party shall, or permit its Affiliates to, take any action, or refrain from taking any action, that would cause any Voting Control Shares to cease to constitute Voting Control Shares prior to the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that sales or transfers of Voting Control Shares to unrelated third parties on arm�s-length terms, or transfers to related third parties who as a condition to such transfer execute and deliver a counterpart signature page hereto and thereby become a PSS Party, shall not be deemed to be a violation of this Section 2.05.

ARTICLE IV
DEFINITIONS
　　SECTION 4.01 Definitions. The following terms as used herein have the following respective meanings:
　　"2007 Annual Meeting" means the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company held in calendar year 2007.
　　"Affiliate" with respect to any person means (i) if such person is an individual, any spouse or minor child (natural or by adoption) of such person; (ii) any trust or family partnership established by such person (if such person is an individual) and/or his or her spouse for the benefit of such person and/or members of his or her immediate family; (iii) the estate of such person (if such person is an individual); or (iv) any entity that, directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, such person. For purposes of this definition, "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct the management and policies of the applicable entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. For purposes of Section 1.01 of this Agreement and subject to the next sentence, a person shall not be considered an "Affiliate" of a PSS Party for purposes of the provisions of this Agreement obligating a PSS Party to cause its "Affiliates" to take or refrain certain actions if that PSS Party does not possess, directly or indirectly, the power to cause such person to comply with the requirements of such provision, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any person controlled by the Company or their respective officers and directors (other than PSS) shall be deemed to be Affiliates of any PSS Party.
　　"Beneficial Ownership" (and related terms such as "Beneficially Owns" or "Beneficial Owner") has the meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however; that for purposes of determining Beneficial Ownership, a person or entity shall be deemed to Beneficially Own any securities which such person has the right to acquire (irrespective of whether such right to acquire such securities is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time, the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of any event or any combination of the foregoing) pursuant to any agreement or upon the exercise of conversion
 
6

rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a person shall not be deemed to Beneficially Own any securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person until such tendered securities are accepted for purchase or exchange by such person. For purposes of this Agreement, no PSS Party or any of their respective Affiliates shall be deemed to Beneficially Own any securities Beneficially Owned by the Company or any person controlled by the Company or any of their respective officers and directors (other than PSS). Under this Agreement, for purposes of calculating the percentage of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock Beneficially Owned by any person or persons, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to include the total number of basic shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding plus the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of stock options which are then "in the money," calculated as follows: the number of option shares to be counted in shares outstanding is calculated individually for each tranche of options (e.g. if the company has 100 tranches, a number of shares potentially issued is calculated for each), in each case by multiplying the number of shares subject to options outstanding per tranche by the difference between the current stock price and the strike price of the applicable tranche of option, and then dividing such number by the then current stock price. For all those tranches for which the strike price is higher than the current stock price, the shares subject to the options are not considered to be outstanding.
　　"Company Board" means the board of directors of the Company and, from and after the effective time of the Merger, the board of directors of the corporation surviving the Merger.
　　"Company Common Stock" means shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company, and any capital stock into or for which such common stock hereafter may be converted or exchanged pursuant to a recapitalization, reclassification, merger or other similar event.

　　"Group" has the same meaning as described in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.
　　"Outside Independent Directors" means any director of the Company (a) who either (i) qualifies as an "independent director" with respect to the Company pursuant to Section 4200(a)(15) of the Nasdaq National Market Marketplace Rules (as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement), or (ii) qualifies as "independent" with respect to the Company under Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement), and (b) whose nomination or appointment was approved by PSS and a majority of the Outside Independent Directors then in office (in each case such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), it being understood that, for purposes of this clause (b), each of the individuals who is a director of the Company as of the date of the Merger Agreement and who satisfies the requirements of clause (a) shall be deemed to have been approved by PSS and a majority of the Outside Independent Directors.
　　"person" means any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust, unincorporated organization or other entity.
 
7

　　"Qualifying Tender Offer" means a tender or exchange offer by PSS, one or more Affiliates of PSS and/or one or more other PSS Parties that (i) is for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (provided, that such tender or exchange offer need not seek to acquire shares of Company Common Stock Beneficially Owned by PSS, any of his Affiliates or any of the other PSS Parties); (ii) is subject to a non-waiveable condition that a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than any shares of Company Common Stock Beneficially Owned by PSS or any of his Affiliates) be validly tendered and accepted for purchase by the offeror; and (iii) includes a commitment by the offeror (to be contained in the offer to purchase pursuant to which the tender or exchange offer is made) to promptly consummate a merger following the completion of the tender or exchange offer, in which all remaining shares of Company Common Stock not Beneficially Owned by PSS, any of his Affiliates or the PSS Parties shall be acquired for the same amount and type of consideration as was paid per share of Company Common Stock pursuant to the tender or exchange offer.
　　"Voting Control Shares" shall mean, with respect to any PSS Party, any shares of Company Common Stock Beneficially Owned by such PSS Party or any of its Affiliates over which such PSS Party has the power to vote or control or direct the voting thereof.
