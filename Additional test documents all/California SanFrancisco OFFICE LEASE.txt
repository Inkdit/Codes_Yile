Real Property Taxes shall not include penalties or interest on delinquent taxes or assessments. Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that certain other buildings exist or encroach upon the Land, that Tenant shall have no liability as to any item of Real Property Taxes attributable or allocable to, or assessed against, buildings other than the Building and that Landlord's good faith determination of the proper allocation of any item of Real Property Taxes allocable to buildings other than the Building shall be binding on Landlord and Tenant.
         (g) The term "Rental" shall include the Basic Monthly Rental set forth in Paragraph J of the Summary of Lease Terms, all additional rent, and any other charges payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder.
         (h) The term "Tenant's Percentage Share" shall mean seventy five (75%) with respect to Operating Expenses and with respect to Real Property Taxes, as applicable (subject to Landlord's right, from time to time, to adjust such percentages to reflect accurate measurements of the Premises or other portions of the Building and/or to reflect changes in Landlord's standard common area load factor).
　　2 TERM. Landlord shall deliver possession of the Premises to Tenant on February 1, 2008. Tenant shall accept such delivery of the Premises, which acceptance shall constitute agreement by Tenant that the Premises are in the condition required by this Lease. The Term shall commence on the date specified in the Summary of Lease Terms and shall expire three (3) years thereafter.
　　3 RENTAL.
         (a) Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord as Basic Monthly Rental for the Premises the sums specified in Paragraph H of the Summary of Lease Terms.
 
6

         (b) Basic Monthly Rental shall be paid to Landlord, in advance, on or before the first day of each and every successive calendar month during the term hereof. In the event the term of this Lease commences on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or ends on a day other than the last day of a calendar month, then the Basic Monthly Rental for the first and/or last fractional months of the term shall be appropriately prorated. All such prorations shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.
         (c) Rental shall be paid to Landlord without notice, demand, deduction or offset in lawful money of the United States in immediately available funds or by good check as described below at the office of Landlord at Landlord's address for notices specified in the Summary of Lease Terms, or to such other person or at such other place as Landlord from time to time may designate in writing. Payments made by check must be drawn either on a California financial institution or on a financial institution that is a member of the Federal Reserve System. All amounts of Rental, if not paid when due, shall bear interest from the date due until paid at an annual rate of interest (the "Interest Rate") equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum annual interest rate allowed by law on such due date for business loans (not primarily for personal, family or household purposes) not exempt from the usury law, or (ii) a rate equal to the sum of two (2) percentage points over the publicly announced reference rate (the "Reference Rate") charged on such due date by the San Francisco Main Office of Bank of America NT & SA (or any successor bank thereto) (or if there is no such publicly announced rate, the rate quoted by such bank in pricing ninety (90) day commercial loans to substantial commercial borrowers). In addition, Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of Rental will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of such costs being extremely difficult to fix. Such costs include, without limitation, processing and accounting charges, and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any encumbrance and/or note secured by an encumbrance covering the Premises. Therefore, if any installment of Rental due from Tenant is not received within five (5) days of when due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum of ten percent (10%) of the overdue Rental as a late charge; provided that, if Rental is not paid when due three (3) times during the term of this Lease and if Landlord shall have notified Tenant in writing that Tenant shall thereafter be entitled to no further grace periods, then thereafter Tenant shall not be entitled to such five (5) day grace period, and such late charge shall be assessed on any Rental not paid by 5:00 p.m. on the date due. The parties agree that this late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord will incur by reason of late payment of Rental by Tenant. Acceptance of any late charge shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant's default with respect to the overdue amount, or prevent Landlord from exercising any of the other rights and remedies available to Landlord.
         (d) Tenant shall pay Landlord an amount equal to the Basic Monthly Rental for the first month of the term of this Lease, which amount Landlord shall apply to the Basic Monthly Rental for such first month.
　　4 TENANT'S SHARE OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND REAL PROPERTY TAXES; ADDITIONAL RENT.
         (a) In addition to the Basic Monthly Rental payable during the term of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, the applicable Tenant's Percentage Share specified in the Summary of Lease Terms of (i) Operating Expenses paid or incurred by
 
7

Landlord in any calendar year during the term of this Lease, and (ii) Real Property Taxes paid or incurred by Landlord in any tax year (July 1 through June 30) during the term of this Lease. If it shall not be lawful for Tenant to reimburse Landlord for any increase in Real Property Taxes as defined herein, the Basic Monthly Rental payable to Landlord prior to the imposition of such increases in Real Property Taxes shall be increased to net Landlord the same net Basic Monthly Rental after imposition of such increases in Real Property Taxes as would have been received by Landlord prior to the imposition of such increases in Real Property Taxes.
         (b) On or before December 15 of each calendar year or as soon thereafter as practicable, Landlord shall give Tenant notice of its estimate of the amounts payable pursuant to Paragraph 4(a) above for the succeeding calendar year. On or before the first day of each month during the succeeding calendar year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, one twelfth (1/12) of such estimated amounts. If Landlord fails to deliver such notice to Tenant on or before December 15, Tenant shall continue to pay the applicable Tenant's Percentage Share specified in the Summary of Lease Terms of Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes on the basis of the prior year's estimate until the first day of the next calendar month after not less than fifteen (15) days after such notice is given, provided that on such date Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of such estimated adjustment payable to Landlord for prior months during the year in question, less any portion thereof previously paid by Tenant. If at any time it appears to Landlord that the amounts payable under this Paragraph 4(b) for the current calendar year will vary from Landlord's estimate, Landlord may, by giving written notice to Tenant, revise Landlord's estimate for such year, and subsequent payments by Tenant for such year shall be based on such revised estimate.
         (c) Within ninety (90) days after the close of each calendar year, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement of the amounts payable under Paragraph 4(a) above for such calendar year. If on the basis of such statement Tenant owes an amount that is more than the estimated payments for such calendar year previously made by Tenant, Tenant shall pay the deficiency to Landlord within thirty (30) days after delivery of the statement. If on the basis of such statement Tenant has paid to Landlord an amount in excess of the amounts payable under Paragraph 4(a) above for the preceding calendar year then Landlord, at its option, shall either promptly refund such excess to Tenant or credit the amount thereof to the Basic Monthly Rental next becoming due from Tenant until such credit has been exhausted. Within ninety (90) days after receipt of Landlord's statement, Tenant shall have the right to audit at Landlord's local offices, at Tenant's expense, Landlord's accounts and records relating to Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes. Such audit shall be conducted by an employee of Tenant or a certified public accountant approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If such audit reveals that Landlord has overcharged Tenant, the amount overcharged shall be paid to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the audit is concluded, together with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, from the date the statement was delivered to Tenant until payment of the overcharge is made to Tenant. In addition, if the statement exceeds the actual Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes which should have been charged to Tenant by more than five percent (5%), the cost of the audit shall be paid by Landlord.
         (d) If this Lease terminates on a day other than the last day of a calendar year, the amounts payable by Tenant under Paragraph 4(a) above with respect to the calendar year in
 
8

which such termination occurs shall be prorated on the basis which the number of days from the commencement of such calendar year, to and including such termination date, bears to 360. The termination of this Lease shall not affect the obligations of Landlord and Tenant pursuant to Paragraph 4(c) above to be performed after such termination.
         (e) It is the intention of Landlord and Tenant that the Basic Monthly Rental paid to Landlord throughout the term of this Lease shall be absolutely net of Real Property Taxes and Operating Expenses, and the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 4 are intended to so provide.
　　5 OTHER TAXES PAYABLE BY TENANT. Tenant shall reimburse Landlord upon demand for any and all taxes, but not including Real Property Taxes, payable by Landlord (other than state, local and federal personal or corporate income taxes measured by the net income of Landlord from all sources, estate or inheritance taxes) whether or not now customary or within the contemplation of the parties hereto:
         (a) imposed upon, measured by or reasonably attributable to the cost or value of Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures and other personal property located in the Premises or by the cost or value of any leasehold improvements made in or to the Premises by or for Tenant, other than Base Building Improvements made by Landlord, regardless of whether title to such improvements shall be in Tenant or Landlord;
         (b) imposed upon or measured by the Basic Monthly Rental payable hereunder, including, without limitation, any gross income tax or excise tax levied by the City and County of San Francisco, the State of California, the federal government or any other governmental body with respect to the receipt of such rental; or
         (c) imposed upon or with respect to the possession, leasing, operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by Tenant of the Premises or any portion thereof.
         In the event that it shall not be lawful for Tenant to so reimburse Landlord, the Basic Monthly Rental payable to Landlord under this Lease shall be revised to net Landlord the same income after imposition of any such tax upon Landlord as would have been received by Landlord hereunder prior to the imposition of any such tax.
　　6 USE. Tenant agrees to use the Premises for general office purposes and agrees not to use nor permit the use of the Premises or any part thereof for any other purpose. Tenant agrees not to do or permit to be done in or about the Premises or the Building, nor to bring or keep or permit to be brought or kept in or about the Premises or the Building, anything which is prohibited by or will in any way conflict with any law, statute or governmental regulation now or hereafter in effect, or which would subject Landlord or Landlord's agents to any liability, or which is prohibited by the standard form of fire insurance policy, or which will in any way increase the existing rate of (or otherwise affect) fire or any other insurance on the Building or any of its contents. If any act or omission of Tenant results in any such increase in premium rates, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, upon demand the amount of such increase. Tenant agrees not to do or permit to be done anything in, on or about the Premises or the
 
9

Building which will in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other tenants or occupants of the Building, or injure or annoy them, or use or allow the Premises to be used for any improper, immoral, unlawful or objectionable purpose. Tenant agrees not to cause, maintain or permit any nuisance in, on or about the Premises or the Building, nor to use or permit to be used any loudspeaker or other device, system or apparatus which can be heard outside the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord nor to permit any objectionable odors, bright lights or electrical or radio interference which may annoy or interfere with the rights of other tenants of the Building or the public. Tenant agrees not to commit or suffer to be committed any waste in or upon the Premises. The provisions of this Paragraph 6 are for the benefit of Landlord only and shall not be construed to be for the benefit of any tenant or occupant of the Building.
　　7 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS/ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.
         (a) Tenant agrees at its sole cost and expense to promptly comply in all material respects with all laws, statutes, ordinances and governmental rules, regulations or requirements now or hereafter constituted, any direction or occupancy certificate issued pursuant to law by any public officer, and the provisions of all recorded documents affecting the Premises (collectively "Laws"), insofar as any thereof relates to or affects the condition, use or occupancy of the Premises, excluding any Laws the provisions of which are not directly related to Tenant's particular improvements, acts or particular use of the Premises, as opposed to the use of tenants generally. The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in any action against Tenant (whether Landlord be a party thereto or not) that Tenant has violated any such law, statute, ordinance or governmental rule, regulation, requirement, direction or provision, shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant. If Tenant's use or operation of the Premises or any of Tenant's equipment therein requires a governmental permit, license or other authorization or any notice to any governmental agency, Tenant shall promptly provide a copy thereof to Landlord.
         (b) Tenant shall not bring or keep, or permit to be brought or kept, in the Premises or in or on the Real Property any "hazardous substance" (as hereinafter defined), except in the ordinary course of Tenant's business and only in compliance with all applicable Laws. Tenant shall not manufacture, generate, treat, handle, store or dispose of any hazardous substance in the Premises or in or on the Real Property, or use the Premises for any such purpose, or emit, release or discharge any hazardous substance into any air, soil, surface water or groundwater comprising the Premises or the Real Property, or permit any person using or occupying the Premises to do any of the foregoing. Tenant shall comply, and shall cause all persons using or occupying the Premises to comply, with all "environmental laws" (as hereinafter defined) applicable to the Premises as a result of Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises or Tenant's operation or activity therein. As used in this Lease, "hazardous substance" shall mean any substance or material that is described as a toxic, hazardous, corrosive, ignitable, flammable or reactive substance, waste or material or a pollutant or contaminant, or words of similar import, in any of the environmental laws, and includes asbestos, petroleum, petroleum products, polychlorinated biphenyls, radon gas, radioactive matter, and chemicals which may cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. As used in this Lease, "environmental laws" shall mean all federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations now or hereafter in force, as amended from time to time, in any way relating to or regulating human health or safety, or
 
10

industrial hygiene or environmental conditions, or protection of the environment, or pollution or contamination of the air, soil, surface water or groundwater.
         (c) Each party shall immediately furnish the other party with any (i) notices received from any insurance company or governmental agency or inspection bureau regarding any unsafe or unlawful conditions within the Premises or Building, and (ii) notices or other communications sent to any person relating to environmental laws or hazardous substances.
         (d) California law requires landlords to disclose to tenants the existence of certain hazardous substances. Accordingly, the existence of gasoline and other automotive fluids, asbestos containing materials, maintenance fluids, copying fluids and other office supplies and equipment, certain construction and finish materials, tobacco smoke, cosmetics and other personal items must be disclosed. Gasoline and other automotive fluids are found in the parking area of the Real Property. Cleaning, lubricating and hydraulic fluids used in the operation and maintenance of the Building are found in the utility areas of the Building not generally accessible to Building occupants or the public. Many Building occupants use copy machines and printers with associated fluids and toners, and pens, markers, inks, and office equipment that may contain hazardous substances. Certain adhesives, paints and other construction materials and finishes used in portions of the Building may contain hazardous substances. Although smoking is prohibited in the public areas or the Building, these areas may from time to time be exposed to tobacco smoke. Building occupants and other persons entering the Building from time to time may use or carry prescription and non-prescription drugs, perfumes, cosmetics and other toiletries, and foods and beverages, some of which may contain hazardous substances.
         (e) The provisions of this Paragraph 7 are for the benefit of Landlord only and shall not be construed to be for the benefit of any tenant or occupant of the Building.
　　8 ALTERATIONS; LIENS.
         (a) Tenant agrees not to make or suffer to be made any alteration, addition or improvement to or of the Premises (hereinafter referred to as "Alterations"), or any part thereof, without the prior written consent of Landlord. Any such Alterations made by Tenant, including without limitation any fixed partitions or carpeting, shall become a part of the Building and belong to Landlord; provided, however, that equipment, trade fixtures and movable furniture shall remain the property of Tenant. If Landlord consents to the making of any Alterations, the same shall be designed and constructed or installed by Tenant at its expense (including expenses incurred in complying with applicable laws, including laws relating to the handling and disposal of ACM). Tenant shall use a general contractor, subcontractors, engineers and architects approved by Landlord, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. All Alterations shall be made in accordance with plans and specifications approved in writing by Landlord and shall be designed and constructed in compliance with all applicable codes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. The design and construction of any Alterations shall be performed in accordance with Landlord's applicable rules, regulations and requirements, including the Asbestos Rules. Under no circumstances shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any damage, loss, cost or expense incurred by Tenant on account of Tenant's plans and specifications, Tenant's contractors or subcontractors, design of any work, construction of any work, or delay in completion of any work. All sums due to such contractors, if paid by Landlord
 
11

due to Tenant's failure to pay such sums when due, shall bear interest payable to Landlord at the Interest Rate until fully paid. Upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, Tenant, at its expense, shall promptly remove any such Alterations made by Tenant and designated by Landlord (at the same time Landlord gives its consent to their installation) so to be removed and repair any damage to the Premises caused by such removal.
         (b) Tenant agrees to keep the Premises and the Real Property free from any liens arising out of any work performed, materials furnished or obligations incurred by Tenant. Tenant shall promptly and fully pay and discharge all claims on which any such lien could be based. In the event that Tenant does not, within twenty (20) days following the recording of notice of any such lien, cause the same to be released of record, Landlord shall have, in addition to all other remedies provided herein and by law, the right, but not the obligation, to cause the same to be released by such means as it shall deem proper, including payment of the claim giving rise to such lien. All sums paid by Landlord for such purpose, and all expenses incurred by it in connection therewith, shall be payable to Landlord by Tenant, as additional rent, on demand, together with interest at the Interest Rate from the date such expenses are incurred by Landlord to the date of the payment thereof by Tenant to Landlord. Landlord shall have the right at all times to post and keep posted on the Premises any notices permitted or required by law, or which Landlord shall deem proper for the protection of Landlord, the Premises, the Building, or the Real Property, from mechanic's and materialmen's and like liens. Tenant shall give Landlord at least ten (10) days' prior written notice of the date of commencement of any construction on the Premises in order to permit the posting of such notices.
　　9 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
         (a) By taking possession of the Premises, Tenant accepts the Premises as being in the condition in which Landlord is obligated to deliver the Premises. Tenant, at its expense, shall at all times keep the Premises and every part thereof and all equipment, fixtures and improvements therein in good and sanitary order, condition and repair, damage thereto by fire, the perils of the extended coverage endorsement, earthquake and matters that are the responsibility of Landlord under Paragraph 9(b) below excepted, and Tenant waives all rights under, and benefits of, subsection 1 of Section 1932 and Sections 1941 and 1942 of the California Civil Code and under any similar law or ordinance now or hereafter in effect. Upon the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease, Tenant shall surrender the Premises and (unless designated by Landlord to be removed in accordance with Paragraph 8 above) all Alterations thereto to Landlord in the same condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear (except such as Tenant is obligated to repair to keep the Premises in good condition and repair) and damage thereto by fire, the perils of the extended coverage endorsement, and earthquake excepted. It is agreed that Landlord has no obligation, and has made no promises, to alter, add to, remodel, improve, repair, decorate or paint the Premises or any part thereof and that no representations respecting the condition of the Premises, the Building or the Real Property have been made by Landlord to Tenant except as may be specifically set forth in this Lease and the Work Letter. Except as may be specifically set forth in this Lease and the Work Letter, no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made with respect to (i) the condition of the Premises or the Building, (ii) the fitness of the Premises for Tenant's intended use, (iii) the degree of sound transfer within the Building, (iv) the absence of electrical or radio interference in the Premises or the Building, (v) the condition, capacity or performance of electrical or
 
12

communications systems or facilities, or (vi) the absence of objectionable odors, bright lights or other conditions which may affect Tenant's use and enjoyment of the Premises or the Building.
         (b) Landlord agrees to make all necessary repairs to the structure, the exterior, and the public and common areas of the Real Property and all building systems therein, and to maintain the same in reasonably good order and condition. Any damage arising from the acts of Tenant, its agents, employees, contractors or invitees shall be repaired by Landlord at Tenant's sole expense, subject to the provisions of Paragraph 14, entitled "Insurance" and Paragraph 19, entitled "Damage by Fire or Other Casualty".
　　10 SERVICES.
         (a) Provided that Tenant is not in default in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions beyond any applicable cure period under this Lease to be performed or observed by it and the Lease has not terminated, Landlord, subject to the terms of this Paragraph 10 and the Building Rules and Regulations attached hereto as Exhibit B and subject to applicable laws, regulations and rules of public utilities, shall furnish to the Premises water, electrical power and elevator service suitable for the use of the Premises for ordinary office purposes; heating and air conditioning suitable for the comfortable use and occupation of the Premises (assuming normal office use thereof and subject to any restrictions on use as may be prescribed by any applicable policies or regulations of any utility or governmental agency); and basic janitorial service on weekdays (excluding union holidays). Tenant agrees to pay, as additional rent, promptly on demand any and all costs incurred by Landlord in connection with providing any additional utilities and services Landlord may provide at the request of Tenant. Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Lease, all means of distribution of all utilities within the Premises shall be supplied by Tenant at its expense, and Tenant shall bear the cost of water, gas, electricity, sewerage and other utilities. Landlord reserves the right to install, at Tenant's expense, a separate meter in the Premises for electricity in the event that Landlord in its reasonable opinion believes that Tenant is using substantially more than the amount of utilities typically used by office users in similar buildings. Tenant agrees that at all times it will cooperate fully with Landlord and abide by all regulations and requirements that Landlord may prescribe for the proper functioning and protection of the Building heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems. Landlord shall not be liable for and Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction of Rental by reason of Landlord's failure to furnish any of the foregoing or any other utilities or services when such failure is caused by accident, breakage, repairs, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances or disputes of any character, by the limitation, curtailment, rationing or restrictions on use of electricity, gas or any form of energy, or by any other cause, similar or dissimilar, beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, unless such interruption continues for a period in excess of three consecutive business days, in which case Rental shall be abated in proportion to the extent to which Tenant's use of the Premises is impaired. No such failure and no interruption of utilities or services from any cause whatsoever shall constitute an eviction of Tenant, constructive or otherwise, or impose upon Landlord any liability whatsoever, including, but not limited to, liability for consequential damages or loss of business by Tenant. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1932(1) or any other applicable existing or future law, ordinance or governmental regulation permitting the termination of this Lease due to such failure or interruption. Landlord shall not be liable under any circumstances for injury to or death of any person or damage to or destruction of
 
13

property, however occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to the furnishing of or the failure to furnish any of the foregoing utilities or services or any other utilities or services.
         (b) Landlord makes no representation to Tenant regarding the adequacy or fitness of the heating, air conditioning or ventilation equipment in the Building to maintain temperatures that may be required for, or because of, any of Tenant's equipment which uses other than the fractional horsepower normally required for office equipment, and Landlord shall have no liability for loss or damage suffered by Tenant or others in connection therewith. If Tenant's use of the heating, air conditioning or ventilation system exceeds normal office use and thereby causes damages to any of the air conditioning units or other equipment, the cost to repair or replace any such units or equipment due to such use shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord, as additional rent, upon demand by Landlord. If the temperature otherwise maintained in any portion of the Premises by the heating, air conditioning or ventilation system is materially and adversely affected as a result of (i) any lights, machines or equipment (including without limitation electronic data processing machines) used by Tenant in the Premises, (ii) the occupancy of the Premises by more than one person per two hundred (200) square feet of rentable area therein, (iii) an electrical load for lighting or power in excess of the limits per square foot of rentable area of the Premises specified in Paragraph 10(c) below, or (iv) any rearrangement of partitioning or other improvements, Landlord shall have the right to install supplementary air conditioning units or other equipment Landlord deems appropriate in the Premises, and the cost thereof, including the actual and reasonable cost of installation, operation and maintenance thereof, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord, as additional rent, upon demand by Landlord.
         (c) Tenant agrees it will not, without the written consent of Landlord, use any equipment, apparatus or device in the Premises which will, individually or in the aggregate, in any way cause the amount of electricity, water or heating, ventilation or air conditioning supplied to the Premises to materially exceed the amount usually furnished or supplied to premises being used as general office space, or connect with electric current (except through existing electrical outlets in the Premises) or with water pipes any equipment, apparatus or device for the purposes of using electric current or water. Landlord shall not, in any way, be liable or responsible to Tenant for any loss or damage or expense which Tenant may incur or sustain if, for any reasons beyond Landlord's reasonable control, either the quantity or character of electric service is changed or is no longer available or suitable for Tenant's requirements. Tenant covenants that at all times its use of electric current shall never exceed the capacity of the feeders, risers or electrical installations of the Building. If sub metering of electricity in the Building will not be permitted under future laws or regulations, the Basic Monthly Rental will then be equitable adjusted to include an additional payment to Landlord reflecting the cost to Landlord for furnishing electricity to the Premises.
         (d) In the event any governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Real Property or the Building promulgates or revises any law, ordinance or regulation or building, fire or other code or imposes mandatory or voluntary controls or guidelines on Landlord or the Real Property or the Building relating to the use or conservation of energy or utilities or the reduction of automobile or other emissions (collectively "Controls") or in the event Landlord is required or elects to make alterations to the Real Property or the Building in order to comply with such mandatory or voluntary Controls, Landlord may, in its commercially reasonable discretion,
 
14

comply with such Controls or make such alterations to the Real Property or the Building related thereto. Such compliance and the making of such alterations shall not constitute an eviction of Tenant, constructive or otherwise, or impose upon Landlord any liability whatsoever, including, but not limited to, liability for consequential damages or loss of business by Tenant, provided that Landlord uses commercially reasonable efforts to minimize interference with Tenant's use.
　　11 ACCESS CONTROL.
         (a) Landlord shall have the right from time to time to adopt such policies, procedures and programs as it shall, in Landlord's reasonable discretion, deem necessary or appropriate for the security of the Building, and Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord in the enforcement of, and shall comply in all material respects with, the policies, procedures and programs adopted by Landlord insofar as the same pertain to Tenant, its agents, employees, contractors and invitees, all such policies, procedures and programs adopted by Landlord shall be reasonable, non-discriminatory and evenly applied by Landlord.
         (b) In no event shall Landlord be liable for damages resulting from any error with regard to the admission to or the exclusion from the Building of any person. In the case of invasion, mob, riot, public demonstration or other circumstances rendering such action advisable in Landlord's opinion, Landlord reserves the right to prevent access to the Building during the continuance of the same by such action as Landlord may deem appropriate, including closing doors.
         (c) In the event of any picketing, public demonstration or other threat to the security of the Building that is attributable in whole or in part to Tenant, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any costs incurred by Landlord in connection with such picketing, demonstration or other threat in order to protect the security of the Building, and Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and protect and defend Landlord against any and all claims, demands, suits, liability, damage or loss and against all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith, arising out of or relating to any such picketing, demonstration or other threat. Tenant agrees not to employ any person, entity or contractor for any work in the Premises (including moving Tenant's equipment and furnishings in, out or around the Premises) whose presence may give rise to a labor or other disturbance in the Building and, if necessary to prevent such a disturbance in a particular situation, Landlord may require Tenant to employ union labor for the work. In the event of any picketing, public demonstration or other threat to the security of the Building that is attributable in whole or in part to Landlord, Landlord agrees to exclude from Operating Expenses any costs incurred by Landlord in connection with such picketing, demonstration or other threat.
　　12 ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.
         (a) Restriction on Transfers. Except in connection with a "Permitted Transfer" (defined below) Tenant shall not, either voluntarily or by operation of law, (i) assign or transfer this Lease or any interest herein, (ii) sublet the Premises, or any part thereof, or (iii) enter into a license agreement or other arrangement whereby the Premises, or any portion thereof, are held or utilized by another party (each of the foregoing, excluding Permitted Transfers, defined herein as a "Transfer"), without the express prior written consent of Landlord, which consent
 
15

Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay. Any such Transfer (whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise) without the consent of Landlord pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph 12 shall, at Landlord's option, be void and/or constitute an Event of Default under this Lease. Consent to any Transfer shall neither relieve Tenant of the necessity of obtaining Landlord's consent to any future Transfer nor relieve Tenant from any liability under this Lease. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Tenant may assign this Lease or sublet the Premises, or any portion thereof, without Landlord's consent, to any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Tenant; to any entity which results from a merger of, reorganization of, or consolidation with Tenant; to any entity engaged in a joint venture with Tenant; or to any entity which acquires substantially all of the stock or assets of Tenant, as a going concern, with respect to the business that is being conducted in the Premises (hereinafter each a "Permitted Transfer" and any transferee thereof a "Permitted Transferee"). In addition, a sale or transfer of the capital stock, membership or interests of Tenant shall be deemed a Permitted Transfer if (1) such sale or transfer occurs in connection with any bona fide financing or capitalization for the benefit of Tenant, or (2) Tenant is or as a result of such sale or transfer becomes, a publicly traded corporation. In addition the Transfer is between Tenant's shareholders, to their immediate family members, or to any trust or other estate planning vehicle shall be deemed a Permitted Transfer. Landlord shall have no right to terminate the Lease in connection with, and shall have no right to any sums or other economic consideration resulting from, any Permitted Transfer.
　　By way of example and without limitation, the failure to satisfy any of the following conditions or standards shall be deemed to constitute sufficient grounds for Landlord to refuse to grant its consent to the proposed Transfer.
　　　　　　　(i) The proposed assignee must expressly assume all of the provisions, covenants and conditions of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be kept and performed, and any proposed subtenant must expressly acknowledge that its sublease is subordinate to the terms of this Lease.
　　　　　　　(ii) The proposed Transferee must satisfy Landlord's then current credit and other standards for tenants of the Building (taking into account Tenant's continuing liability under this Lease and taking into account whether or not Tenant is continuing in occupancy of a material portion of the Premises) and, in Landlord's reasonable opinion, have the financial strength and stability to perform all of the obligations of the Tenant under this Lease (as they apply to the transferred space) as and when they fall due.
　　　　　　　(iii) The proposed Transferee must be reasonably satisfactory to Landlord as to character and professional standing.
　　　　　　　(iv) The proposed use of the Premises by the proposed Transferee must be, in Landlord's commercially reasonable opinion: (a) lawful; (b) appropriate to the location and configuration of the Premises; (c) unlikely to cause an increase in insurance premiums for insurance policies applicable to the Building; (d) a use not requiring any new tenant improvements that Landlord would be entitled to disapprove pursuant to Paragraph 8 hereof; (e) unlikely to cause any material increase in services to be provided to the Premises; (f) unlikely to create any materially increased burden in the operation of the Building, or in the operation of any
 
16

of its facilities or equipment; and (g) unlikely to impair the dignity, reputation or character of the Building.
　　　　　　　(v) The proposed use of the Premises must not result in the division of the Premises into more than two (2) parcels or tenant spaces.
　　　　　　　(vi) At the time of the proposed Transfer, an Event of Default (as defined in paragraph 18(a) below) shall not have occurred and be continuing, and at the time of the proposed Transfer, no event may have occurred that with notice, the passage of time, or both, would become an Event of Default.
　　　　　　　(vii) The proposed Transferee shall not be a governmental entity or hold any exemption from the payment of ad valorem or other taxes which would prohibit Landlord from collecting from such Transferee any amounts otherwise payable under this Lease.
　　　　　　　(viii) The proposed Transferee shall not be a then present tenant or affiliate or subsidiary of a then present tenant in the Building unless there is no other suitable space available in the Building.
　　　　　　　(ix) Landlord shall not be negotiating with, and shall not have at any time within the past thirty (30) days negotiated with, the proposed Transferee for space in the Building (unless Landlord, in its reasonable judgment, believes that it is unlikely that any further discussions between Tenant and such proposed Transferee will lead to a lease transaction).
         (b) Landlord's Right of First Offer; Termination Right. Except in the event of a proposed Transfer pursuant to Paragraphs 12(e) or 12(f) below, Landlord shall have no obligation to consent or consider granting its consent to any proposed Transfer unless Tenant has first delivered to Landlord a written offer to enter into such Transfer with Landlord, which offer shall include the base rent and other economic terms of the proposed Transfer, the date upon which Tenant desires to effect such Transfer and all of the other material terms of the proposed Transfer ("Tenant's Offer"). Landlord shall have ten (10) days from receipt of Tenant's Offer within which to notify Tenant in writing of its decision to accept or reject such Transfer on the terms set forth in Tenant's Offer. If Landlord does not accept Tenant's Offer within such period, Tenant may enter into such Transfer with any bona fide independent third-party Transferee (as defined in Paragraph 12(c) below) within one hundred twenty (120) days of the end of such ten (10) day period, so long as such Transfer is for the same base rent offered to Landlord in Tenant's Offer and such Transfer otherwise contains terms not more than five percent (5%) more favorable economically to the Transferee than the terms stated in Tenant's Offer, taking into account all rent concessions, tenant improvements, and any other terms which have an economic impact on the Transfer; provided, however, that the prior written approval of Landlord for such Transfer must be obtained, and the other provisions of this Paragraph 12 must be complied with, all in accordance with this Paragraph 12. If Landlord accepts Tenant's Offer, Landlord and Tenant shall enter into an agreement for such Transfer within thirty (30) days of the date Landlord makes its election.
         Except in the event of a proposed Transfer pursuant to Paragraphs 12(e) or 12(f) below, in the case of a proposed assignment of this Lease or a sublease of substantially the entire
 
17

Premises for substantially the balance of the term of this Lease, then in addition to the foregoing rights of Landlord, Landlord shall have the right, by notice to Tenant within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Tenant's Offer, to terminate this Lease, which termination shall be effective as of the date on which the intended assignment or sublease would have been effective if Landlord had not exercised such termination right. If Landlord elects to terminate this Lease, then from and after the date of such termination, Landlord and Tenant each shall have no further obligation to the other under this Lease with respect to the Premises except for matters occurring or obligations arising hereunder prior to the date of such termination.
         Landlord's foregoing rights and options shall continue throughout the entire term of this Lease.
         (c) Landlord's Approval Process. Tenant shall, in each instance of a proposed Transfer, give written notice to Landlord at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of any proposed Transfer, specifying in such notice (i) the nature of the proposed Transfer, (ii) the portion of the Premises to be transferred, (iii) the intended use of the transferred Premises, (iv) all economic terms of the proposed Transfer, (v) the effective date thereof, (vi) the identity of the transferee under the proposed Transfer (the "Transferee"), (vii) current financial statements of the Transferee, and (viii) detailed documentation relating to the business experience of the Transferee (collectively, "Tenant's Notice"). Tenant shall also promptly furnish Landlord with any other information reasonably requested by Landlord relating to the proposed Transfer or the proposed Transferee. Within ten (10) days after receipt by Landlord of Tenant's Notice and any additional information and data requested by Landlord, Landlord shall notify Tenant of its determination to either (i) consent to the proposed Transfer, or (ii) refuse to consent to such proposed Transfer.
         (d) Consideration for Transfer. Fifty percent (50%) of all (i) consideration paid or payable by Transferee to Tenant as consideration for any such Transfer, and (ii) rents received in connection with the Transfer by Tenant from Transferee in excess of the Rental payable by Tenant to Landlord under this Lease shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord immediately upon receipt thereof by Tenant. Upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall assign to Landlord all amounts to be paid to Tenant by any Transferee and shall direct such Transferee to pay the same directly to Landlord.
         If this Lease is assigned, whether or not in violation of the terms of this Lease, Landlord may collect rent from the assignee. If the Premises or any part thereof is sublet, Landlord may, upon an Event of Default by Tenant hereunder, collect rent from the subtenant. In either event, Landlord may apply the amount collected from the assignee or subtenant to Tenant's monetary obligations hereunder. Neither Landlord's collection of rent from a Transferee nor any course of dealing between Landlord and any Transferee shall constitute or be deemed to constitute Landlord's consent to any Transfer.
         (e) Merger or Consolidation of Tenant; Major Changes. Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer, as described in Paragraph 12(a) above, any Transfer to any corporation or entity Controlled (as hereinafter defined) by Tenant, or to the surviving corporation in the event of a consolidation or merger to which Tenant shall be a party and any Major Change (as hereinafter defined) must be approved by Landlord in accordance with
 
18

Paragraph 12(c) above and, without such approval, shall at Landlord's election be void and/or constitute an Event of Default. The term "Controlled" as used herein shall mean the ownership of (i) the voting stock of any corporation, or (ii) the ownership interest in any other entity and, if any such entity is a partnership, a general partner's interest in such partnership. The term "Major Change" as used herein shall mean any reorganization, recapitalization, refinancing or other transaction or series of transactions involving Tenant which results in the net worth of Tenant and its consolidated subsidiaries immediately after such transaction(s) being less than fifty percent (50%) of the net worth of Tenant and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of this Lease.
         (f) Transfer of Partnership Interest or Corporate Stock. Except in connection with Permitted Transfer, as described in Paragraph 12(a) above, a sale, transfer or assignment of a general partner's interest or any portion thereof in Tenant, if Tenant is a partnership, or a sale, transfer or assignment of forty-nine percent (49%) or more of the voting stock of Tenant if Tenant is a corporation, whether such sale, transfer or assignment occurs in a single transaction or a series of transactions, shall be deemed a Transfer and require Landlord's consent in accordance with the procedures specified in Paragraph 12(c) above.
         (g) Documentation. Tenant agrees that any instrument by which Tenant assigns this Lease or any interest therein or sublets or otherwise Transfers all or any portion of the Premises shall expressly provide that the Transferee may not further assign this Lease or any interest therein or sublet the sublet space without Landlord's prior written consent (which consent shall be subject to the provisions of this Paragraph 12), and that the Transferee will comply with all of the provisions of this Lease and that Landlord may enforce the Lease provisions directly against such Transferee. No permitted assignment shall be effective unless and until there has been delivered to Landlord a counterpart of the assignment in which the assignee assumes all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease arising on or after the date of the assignment.
         (h) Options Personal to Original Tenant and Permitted Transferees. If Landlord consents to a Transfer hereunder and this Lease contains any renewal options, expansion options, rights of first refusal, rights of first negotiation or any other rights or options pertaining to additional space in the Building, such rights and/or options shall not run to the Transferee, it being agreed by the parties hereto that any such rights and options are personal to the original Tenant and named herein and any Permitted Transferee and may not be otherwise transferred.
         (i) Encumbrance of Lease. Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, Tenant shall not mortgage, encumber or hypothecate this Lease or any interest herein without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be withheld in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion. Any such act without the prior written consent of Landlord (whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law or otherwise) shall, at Landlord's option, be void and/or constitute an Event of Default under this Lease.
         (j) No Merger. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease or of the Premises by Tenant or a mutual cancellation of this Lease shall not work a merger, and at the option of Landlord any existing subleases may be terminated or be deemed assigned to Landlord in which latter event the subleases or subtenants shall become tenants of Landlord.
 
19

         (k) Landlord's Costs. Tenant shall pay to Landlord the amount of Landlord's reasonable cost of processing each proposed Transfer requiring Landlord's consent (which shall consist of attorneys' and other professional fees, collectively "Processing Costs"), and the amount of all direct and indirect expenses incurred by Landlord arising from the assignee or sublessee taking occupancy of the subject space (including, without limitation, costs of freight elevator operation for moving of furnishings and trade fixtures, security service, janitorial and cleaning service, and rubbish removal service).
　　13 WAIVER; INDEMNIFICATION. Neither Landlord nor Landlord's agents, nor any shareholder, constituent partner or other owner of Landlord or any agent of Landlord, nor any contractor, officer, director or employee of any thereof shall be liable to Tenant and Tenant waives all claims against Landlord and such other persons for any injury to or death of any person or for loss of use of or damage to or destruction of property in or about the Premises or the Building by or from any cause whatsoever, including without limitation, earthquake or earth movement, gas, fire, oil, electricity or leakage from the roof, walls, basement or other portion of the Premises or the Building, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its agents or employees. Tenant agrees to indemnify and hold Landlord, Landlord's agents, the shareholders, constituent partners and/or other owners of Landlord or any agent of Landlord, and all contractors, officers, directors and employees of any thereof (collectively, "Indemnitees"), and each of them, harmless from and to protect and defend each Indemnitee against any and all claims, demands, suits, liability, damage or loss and against all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection therewith, (a) arising out of any injury or death of any person or damage to or destruction of property occurring in, on or about the Premises, from any cause whatsoever, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (b) occurring in, on or about any facilities (including without limitation elevators, stairways, passageways or hallways) the use of which Tenant has in common with other tenants, or elsewhere in or about the Building or in the vicinity of the Building, to the extent such claim, injury or damage is caused by the act, neglect, default, or omission of any duty by Tenant, its former or current agents, contractors, employees, invitees, or subtenants or other persons in or about the Building by reason of Tenant's occupancy of the Premises, or otherwise by any conduct of any of said persons in or about the Premises or the Real Property, or (c) arising from any failure of Tenant to observe or perform any of its obligations hereunder. If any action or proceeding is brought against any of the Indemnitees by reason of any such claim or liability, Tenant, upon notice from Landlord, covenants to resist and defend at Tenant's sole expense such action or proceeding by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Landlord. The provisions of this Paragraph shall survive the termination of this Lease with respect to any claims or liability occurring prior to such termination.
　　14 INSURANCE.
         (a) At Tenant's expense, Tenant shall procure, carry and maintain in effect throughout the term of this Lease, in a form acceptable to Landlord and with such insurance companies as are acceptable to Landlord (which companies shall have a Best's rating of A VIII or better), the following insurance coverage:
　　　　　　　(i) Commercial general liability insurance on an occurrence basis, with limits in an amount not less than $2,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence, for
 
20

claims or losses arising out of or resulting from personal injury (including bodily injury), death and/or property damage sustained or alleged to have been sustained by any person for any reason on the Premises, for liability arising out of or resulting from Tenant's covenant in Paragraph 13 to indemnify Landlord and all other Indemnities, its agents and employees, and for contractual liability;
　　　　　　　(ii) All Risk Replacement Cost insurance with an agreed amount endorsement upon property of every description and kind owned by Tenant and located in the Premises and for Tenant's Improvements and Alterations in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the full replacement value thereof; and
　　　　　　　(iii) Workers' compensation insurance, in accordance with applicable law.
         All policies of liability insurance so obtained and maintained shall be carried in the name of Tenant, name Landlord and Landlord's designated agents as additional insureds, and shall provide that the insurance policy so endorsed will be the primary insurance providing coverage for Landlord, and contain a cross liability endorsement stating that the rights of insureds shall not be prejudiced by one insured making a claim or commencing an action against another insured. Any other liability insurance maintained by Landlord shall be excess and non- contributing. At Landlord's election, such policies shall name the holder of any Superior Interest or any other interested party as an insured party under a standard mortgagee endorsement.
         (b) All insurance policies required under this Lease shall provide that the insurer shall not cancel, reduce, modify or fail to renew such coverage without thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord. Tenant shall deliver certificates of all insurance required hereunder upon the commencement of the term of this Lease. In the event Tenant does not comply with the requirements of this Paragraph 14, Landlord may, at its option and at Tenant's expense, following ten days notice to Tenant, purchase such insurance coverage to protect Landlord. The cost of such insurance shall be paid to Landlord by Tenant, as additional rent, immediately upon demand therefor, together with interest at the Interest Rate until paid.
         (c) Landlord shall maintain a policy of fire, extended coverage (including special form perils) insurance insuring the Building in which the Premises are located which shall be in amount equal to the current replacement cost of the Building. Landlord shall also have the right to obtain and keep in force during the term of this Lease a policy or policies in the name of Landlord, with loss payable to Landlord and any Lender(s), insuring the loss of the full rental and other charges payable by all lessees of the Building to Landlord for one year (including all Real Property Taxes, insurance costs, all Common Area Costs and any scheduled rental increases). Said insurance may provide that in the event the Lease is terminated by reason of any insured loss, the period of indemnity for such coverage shall be extended beyond the date of the completion of repairs or replacement of the Premises, to provide for one full year's loss of rental revenues from the date of any such loss. The cost of Landlord's insurance shall be an Operating Expense.
         (d) The parties release each other, and their respective authorized representatives, from any claims for loss or damage that are caused by or result from perils
 
21

insured under any insurance policies carried by the parties in force at the time of any such damage. Each party shall cause each insurance policy obtained by it to provide that the insurer waives all right of recovery by way of subrogation against either party in connection with any loss or damage covered by the policy. Neither party shall be liable to the other for any loss or damage caused by the insured risks under any insurance policy required by this Lease.
　　15 PROTECTION OF LENDERS.
         (a) This Lease shall be subject and subordinate at all times to all ground or underlying leases which may now or hereafter exist affecting the Building or the Real Property, or both, and to the lien of any mortgage or deed of trust in any amount or amounts whatsoever now or hereafter placed on or against the Building or the Real Property, or both, or on or against Landlord's interest or estate therein (such mortgages, deeds of trust and leases are referred to herein, collectively, as "Superior Interests"), all without the necessity of any further instrument executed or delivered by or on the part of Tenant for the purpose of effectuating such subordination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver, upon demand, such further instruments evidencing such subordination of this Lease to any such Superior Interest as may be required by Landlord. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a non-disturbance agreement in favor of Tenant from each holder of a Superior Interest, in form reasonably satisfactory to Tenant.
         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed of trust or of any other action or proceeding for the enforcement thereof, or of any sale thereunder, this Lease shall not be terminated or extinguished, nor shall the rights and possession of Tenant hereunder be disturbed, if no Event of Default then exists under this Lease, and Tenant shall attorn to the person who acquires Landlord's interest hereunder through any such mortgage or deed of trust.
         (c) Within ten (10) business days after Landlord's written request, but not more than two (2) times in any calendar year Tenant shall deliver to Landlord, or to any actual or prospective holder of a Superior Interest ("Holder") that Landlord designates, such financial statements as are reasonably required by such Holder to verify the financial condition of Tenant (or any assignee, subtenant or guarantor of Tenant). Tenant represents and warrants to Landlord and such Holder that each financial statement delivered by Tenant shall be accurate in all material respects as of the date of such statement. Landlord covenants that all financial statements shall be kept confidential, used only for the purposes stated herein and requested only in the event of a sale or refinance of the Real Property.
         (d) If Landlord is in default, Tenant will accept cure of any default by any Holder whose name and address shall have been furnished to Tenant in writing. Tenant may not exercise any rights or remedies for Landlord's default unless Tenant gives notice thereof to each such Holder and the default is not cured within thirty (30) days thereafter or such greater time as may be reasonably necessary to cure such default. Tenant's notice to the Holder may be sent concurrently with any notice sent to Landlord. A default which cannot reasonably be cured within said 30 day period shall be deemed cured within said period if work necessary to cure the default is commenced within such time and proceeds diligently thereafter until the default is cured.
 
22

         (e) If any prospective Holder should require, as a condition of any Superior Interest, a modification of the provisions of this Lease, Tenant shall approve and execute any such modifications promptly after request, provided no such modification shall relate to the Rental payable hereunder or the length of the term hereof or otherwise materially alter the rights or obligations of Landlord or Tenant hereunder.
　　16 ENTRY BY LANDLORD
         (a) Provided that Landlord gives no less than twenty-four (24) hours advance notice (except in cases of emergency or in connection with the provision of Landlord services, in connection with which no advance notice shall be required), and shall at all times have, the right to enter the Premises to inspect them; to supply janitorial service and any other service to be provided by Landlord hereunder; to submit the Premises to prospective purchasers, mortgagees or tenants; to post notices of nonresponsibility; and to alter, improve or repair the Premises and any portion of the Building as permitted or provided hereunder, all without abatement of Rental; and may erect scaffolding and other necessary structures in or through the Premises where reasonably required by the character of the work to be performed; provided, however, that any such entrance or work shall not unreasonably interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises. If such entry is made as aforesaid, Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages for any injury or inconvenience to or interference with Tenant's business, any loss of occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the Premises, and any other loss occasioned by such entry, except to the extent that any such entrance or work shall have unreasonably interfered with Tenant's use of the Premises. For each of the foregoing purposes, Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key and/or other access device with which to unlock all of the doors in, on and about the Premises (excluding Tenant's vaults, safes, server rooms and similar areas designated in writing by Tenant in advance and approved by Landlord); and Landlord shall have the right to use any and all means which Landlord may deem proper to open said doors in an emergency in order to obtain entry to the Premises, and any entry to the Premises obtained by Landlord by any of said means, or otherwise, shall not under any circumstances be construed or deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into or a detainer of the Premises, or any portion thereof.
         (b) So long as Tenant's use and quiet enjoyment of the Premises is not materially impaired, Landlord shall also have the right at any time to change the arrangement or location or times of access of entrances or passageways, doors and doorways, and corridors, elevators, stairs, toilets or other public parts of the Building, and to change the name, number or designation by which the Building is commonly known, and none of the foregoing shall be deemed an actual or constructive eviction of Tenant, nor shall it entitle Tenant to any reduction of Rental hereunder or result in any liability of Landlord to Tenant. Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the actual and reasonable costs incurred by Tenant as a result of Landlord's exercise of such rights.
　　17 ABANDONMENT. Tenant shall not abandon the Premises or any part thereof at any time during the term hereof. Tenant understands that if Tenant abandons the Premises, without providing acceptable security, the risk of fire, other casualty and vandalism to the Premises and the Building may be increased. If Tenant abandons or surrenders all or any part of the Premises or is dispossessed of the Premises by process of law, or otherwise, any movable furniture, equipment, trade fixtures, or other personal property belonging to Tenant and left on
 
23

the Premises shall at the option of Landlord be deemed to be abandoned and, whether or not the property is deemed abandoned, Landlord shall have the right to remove such property from the Premises and charge Tenant for the removal and any restoration of the Premises as provided in Paragraph 8(a). Landlord may charge Tenant for the storage of Tenant's property left on the Premises at such rates as Landlord may from time to time reasonably determine, or, Landlord may, at its option, store Tenant's property in a public warehouse at Tenant's expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the provisions of this Paragraph 17 nor any other provision of this Lease shall impose upon Landlord any obligation to care for or preserve any of Tenant's property left upon the Premises, and Tenant hereby waives and releases Landlord from any claim or liability in connection with the removal of such property from the Premises and the storage thereof and specifically waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 with respect to such release. Landlord's action or inaction with regard to the provisions of this Paragraph 17 shall not be construed as a waiver of Landlord's right to require Tenant to remove its property, restore any damage to the Building caused by such removal, and make any restoration required pursuant to Paragraph 8(a) hereof.
　　18 DEFAULT AND REMEDIES.
         (a) The occurrence of any one or more of the following events (each an "Event of Default") shall constitute a breach of this Lease by Tenant:
　　　　　　　(i) Tenant fails to pay any Basic Monthly Rental or additional monthly rent under Paragraph 4(b) hereof as and when such rent becomes due and payable and such failure continues for more than three (3) days after Landlord gives written notice thereof to Tenant (which notice shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, notice as described in California Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2)); or
　　　　　　　(ii) Tenant fails to pay any additional rent or other amount of money or charge payable by Tenant hereunder as and when such additional rent or amount or charge becomes due and payable and such failure continues for more than ten (10) days after Landlord gives written notice thereof to Tenant (which notice shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, notice as described in California Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2)); or
　　　　　　　(iii) Tenant fails to perform or breaches any other agreement or covenant of this Lease to be performed or observed by Tenant as and when performance or observance is due and such failure or breach continues for more than thirty (30) days after Landlord gives written notice thereof to Tenant; provided, however, that if, by the nature of such agreement or covenant, such failure or breach cannot reasonably be cured within such period of thirty (30) days, an Event of Default shall not exist as long as Tenant commences with due diligence and dispatch the curing of such failure or breach within such period of thirty (30) days and, having so commenced, thereafter prosecutes with diligence and dispatch and completes the curing of such failure or breach within a reasonable time; or
　　　　　　　(iv) Tenant (A) is generally not paying its debts as they become due, (B) files, or consents by answer or otherwise to the filing against it of, a petition for relief or reorganization or arrangement or any other petition in bankruptcy or for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy, insolvency or other debtors' relief law of any jurisdiction, (C)
 
24

makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, (D) consents to the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers of Tenant or of any substantial part of Tenant's property, or (E) takes action for the purpose of any of the foregoing; or
　　　　　　　(v) Without consent by Tenant, a court or government authority enters an order, and such order is not vacated within thirty (30) days, (A) appointing a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to Tenant or with respect to any substantial part of Tenant's property, or (B) constituting an order for relief or approving a petition for relief or reorganization or arrangement or any other petition in bankruptcy or for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy, insolvency or other debtors' relief law of any jurisdiction, or (C) ordering the dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of Tenant; or
　　　　　　　(vi) This Lease or any estate of Tenant hereunder is levied upon under any attachment or execution and such attachment or execution is not vacated within thirty (30) days; or
　　　　　　　(vii) Tenant abandons the Premises.
         (b) If an Event of Default occurs, Landlord shall have the right at any time to give a written termination notice to Tenant and, on the date specified in such notice, Tenant's right to possession shall terminate and this Lease shall terminate. Upon such termination, Landlord shall have the right to recover from Tenant:
　　　　　　　(i) The worth at the time of award of all unpaid rent which had been earned at the time of termination;
　　　　　　　(ii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which all unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided;
　　　　　　　(iii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which all unpaid rent for the balance of the term of this Lease after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and
　　　　　　　(iv) All other amounts necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform all of Tenant's obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom.
         The "worth at the time of award" of the amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be computed by allowing interest at the maximum annual interest rate allowed by law for business loans (not primarily for personal, family or household purposes) not exempt from the usury law at the time of termination or, if there is no such maximum annual interest rate, at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum. The "worth at the time of award" of the amount referred to in clause (iii) above shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%). For the purpose of determining unpaid rent under clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the rent reserved in this Lease shall be deemed to be the total rent payable by Tenant under Articles 3 and 4 hereof.
 
25

         (c) Even though Tenant has breached this Lease, this Lease shall continue in effect for so long as Landlord does not terminate Tenant's right to possession, and Landlord shall have all of its rights and remedies, including the right, pursuant to California Civil Code section 1951.4, to recover all rent as it becomes due under this Lease. Acts of maintenance or preservation or efforts to relet the Premises or the appointment of a receiver upon initiative of Landlord to protect Landlord's interest under this Lease shall not constitute a termination of Tenant's right to possession unless written notice of termination is given by Landlord to Tenant.
         (d) The remedies provided for in this Lease are in addition to all other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity by statute or otherwise.
　　19 DAMAGE BY FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY.
         (a) If the Premises are partially destroyed or damaged by fire or other casualty, Landlord shall, within thirty (30) days of such destruction or damage, give Tenant a written estimate of the time required to repair the Premises (the "Repair Notice"). If, in Landlord's judgment, such repairs can be completed within ninety (90) days under the laws and regulations of the state, federal, county and municipal authorities having jurisdiction, the Landlord shall promptly repair such damage, subject to Paragraphs 19(b), 19(c), 19(d) and 19(e) below, and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, provided that if there shall be damage to the Premises from any such cause and such damage is not the result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, its agents, employees, contractors or invitees, Tenant shall be entitled to a reduction of Basic Monthly Rental while such repair is being made in the proportion to the extent to which Tenant's use of the Premises is impaired. Tenant's right to a reduction of Basic Monthly Rental under this Paragraph 19 shall be Tenant's sole remedy in connection with any such damage.
         (b) If such repairs cannot, in Landlord's judgment, be completed within ninety (90) days, or if such damage occurs during the last six (6) months of the term of this Lease, Landlord shall have the option either (i) to repair such damage, this Lease continuing in full force and effect, but with the Basic Monthly Rental proportionately reduced (subject to the condition set forth in Paragraph 19(a) above), or (ii) to give notice to Tenant at any time within thirty (30) days after the occurrence of such damage terminating this Lease as of a date specified in such notice, which shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice. If such notice of termination is so given, the Lease and all interest of Tenant in the Premises shall terminate on the date specified in such notice, and the Basic Monthly Rental, reduced (subject to the condition set forth in Paragraph 19(a) above) in proportion to the extent to which Tenant's use of the Premises is impaired, shall be paid up to the date of such termination, Landlord hereby agreeing to refund to Tenant any Rental theretofore paid for any period of time subsequent to the termination date.
         (c) If the Building is damaged by fire or other casualty to the extent that the repair cost would exceed twenty percent (20%) or more of its replacement value, or if more than twenty percent (20%) of the rentable area of the Building is affected by fire or other casualty and repairs to the Building cannot, in Landlord's judgment, be completed within ninety (90) days, or if insurance proceeds sufficient to complete the repairs are not available due to exercise of rights of a Holder to collect such proceeds, then in any such case, whether the Premises are damaged or
 
26

not, Landlord shall have the right, if necessary in Landlord's reasonable judgment in connection with Landlord's restoration of the Building, at its option, to terminate this Lease by giving Tenant notice thereof within thirty (30) days of such casualty specifying the date of termination which shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice.
         (d) Tenant may terminate this Lease if (i) the Premises are damaged by fire or other casualty not resulting in whole or in part from the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or its employees, agents, contractors or subtenants and Landlord indicates in the Repair Notice that the repair to the Premises cannot, in Landlord's judgment, be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days, assuming the availability of labor and materials; or (ii) in the event Landlord does not complete repairs to the Premises within sixty (60) days of the date specified in the Repair Notice, and such repairs are still uncompleted following fifteen (15) days' written notice to Landlord. Tenant's notice to Landlord of its election to terminate the Lease under (i) or (ii) above must be delivered to Landlord within thirty (30) days after either the Repair Notice (if Tenant's is terminating pursuant to (i)) or expiration of the fifteen-day period (if Tenant is terminating pursuant to (ii)), and the termination shall be as of a date specified in such notice which shall be no less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice. In the event of a termination of the Lease by Tenant under this Paragraph 19(d), the Basic Monthly Rental shall be reduced in the same manner as provided under Paragraph 19(b) above.
         (e) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Lease, Landlord shall in no event be required to repair any injury or damage by fire or other cause whatsoever to, or to make any repairs or replacements of, any panelings, decorations, partitions, railings, ceilings, floor coverings, trade or office fixtures or any other property of, or improvements (including Tenant Improvements and any Alterations) installed on the Premises by or at the election of Tenant. Tenant hereby agrees to promptly repair any damage to Tenant Improvements and any Alterations at its sole cost and expense in the event that Landlord is required to, or elects to, repair the remainder of the Premises pursuant to Paragraphs 19(a) and 19(b) above.
         (f) Tenant hereby waives the provisions of subsection 2 of Section 1932, subsection 4 of Section 1933, and Sections 1941 and 1942 of the California Civil Code.
　　20 EMINENT DOMAIN.
         (a) If all or part of the Premises shall be taken by any public or quasi public authority under the power of eminent domain or conveyance in lieu thereof, this Lease shall terminate as to any portion of the Premises so taken or conveyed on the date when title or the right to possession vests in the condemnor.
         (b) If (i) a part of the Premises shall be taken by any public or quasi public authority under the power of eminent domain or conveyance in lieu thereof; and (ii) Tenant is reasonably able to continue the operation of Tenant's business in that portion of the Premises remaining; and (iii) Landlord elects to restore the Premises to an architectural whole, then this Lease shall remain in effect as to said portion of the Premises remaining, and the Basic Monthly Rental payable from the date of the taking shall be reduced in the same proportion as the area of the Premises taken bears to the total area of the Premises. If, after a partial taking, Tenant is not
 
27

reasonably able to continue the operation of its business in the Premises or Landlord elects not to restore the Premises as hereinabove described, this Lease may be terminated by either Landlord or Tenant by giving written notice to the other party within thirty (30) days of the date of the taking. Such notice shall specify the date of termination which shall be not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days after the date of said notice.
         (c) If a portion of the Building is taken, whether any portion of the Premises is taken or not, and Landlord determines that it is not economically feasible to continue operating the portion of the Building remaining, then Landlord shall have the option for a period of thirty (30) days after such determination to terminate this Lease. If Landlord determines that it is economically feasible to continue operating the portion of the Building remaining after such taking, then this Lease shall remain in effect, with Landlord, at Landlord's cost, restoring the Building to an architectural whole.
         (d) Landlord shall be entitled to any and all payment, income, rent, award, or any interest therein whatsoever which may be paid or made in connection with such taking or conveyance, and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord or otherwise for the value of any unexpired term of this Lease or for the value of any improvements in or to the Premises. Tenant hereby assigns any such claim to the Landlord. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the same shall not diminish Landlord's recovery for such taking, Tenant shall have the right to make a claim directly to the entity expressing the power of eminent domain for moving expenses and for loss or damage to Tenant's trade fixtures, equipment and movable furniture.
         (e) Tenant hereby waives sections 1265.110 through 1265.160 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
　　21 HOLDING OVER. Any holding over after the expiration or other termination of the term of this Lease with the written consent of Landlord delivered to Tenant shall be construed to be a tenancy from month to month at the Basic Monthly Rental in effect on the date of such expiration or termination (subject to adjustment as provided in Paragraph 3(c) hereof) on the terms, covenants and conditions herein specified so far as applicable. Landlord shall give Tenant not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of Landlord's intent to terminate any such month to month holdover tenancy. Any holding over after the expiration or other termination of the term of this Lease without the written consent of Landlord shall be construed to be a tenancy at sufferance on all the terms set forth herein, except that the Basic Monthly Rental shall be an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Basic Monthly Rental payable by Tenant immediately prior to such holding over. Acceptance by Landlord of Rental after the expiration or termination of this Lease shall not constitute a consent by Landlord to any such tenancy from month to month or result in any other tenancy or any renewal of the term hereof. The provisions of this Paragraph are in addition to, and do not affect, Landlord's right to re entry or other rights hereunder or provided by law.
　　22 INTENTIONALLY DELETED.
　　23 MISCELLANEOUS.
 
28

         (a) Limitation of Landlord's Liability. Any liability of Landlord (including without limitation Landlord's partners, shareholders, affiliates, agents, and employees) to Tenant under this Lease shall be limited to the equity interest of Landlord in the Building and Tenant agrees to look solely to such interest, and any sales proceeds therefrom, for the recovery of any judgment, it being intended that Landlord and such other persons shall not be personally liable for any deficiency or judgment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, Landlord shall not be liable for any consequential damages, nor shall Landlord be liable for loss of or damage to artwork, currency, jewelry, bullion, unique or valuable documents, securities or other valuables, or for other property not in the nature of ordinary fixtures, furnishings and equipment used in general administrative and executive office activities and functions. Wherever in this Lease Tenant (a) releases Landlord from any claim or liability, (b) waives or limits any right of Tenant to assert any claim against Landlord or to seek recourse against any property of Landlord or (c) agrees to indemnify Landlord against any matters, the relevant release, waiver, limitation or indemnity shall run in favor of and apply to Landlord, its agents, the constituent shareholders, partners or other owners of Landlord or its agents, and the directors, officers, and employees of Landlord and its agents and each such constituent shareholder, partner or other owner.
         (b) Sale by Landlord. In the event of a sale or conveyance of the Building by any owner of the reversion then constituting Landlord, the transferor shall thereby be released from any future liability upon any of the terms, covenants or conditions (express or implied) herein contained in favor of Tenant, and in such event, insofar as such transferor is concerned, Tenant agrees to look solely to the successor in interest of such transferor in and to the Building and this Lease. Tenant agrees to attorn to the successor in interest of such transferor. If Tenant provides Landlord with any security for Tenant's performance of its obligations hereunder, and Landlord transfers, or provides a credit with respect to, such security to the grantee or transferee of Landlord's interest in the Real Property, Landlord shall be released from any further responsibility or liability for such security.
         (c) Estoppel Letter. Each party (a "Responding Party"), at any time and from time to time within ten (10) business days following request from the other party ("Requesting Party") shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Requesting Party a statement in writing, (i) certifying that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified, stating the nature of such modification and certifying that this Lease as so modified is in full force and effect), (ii) certifying that there are not, to the responding Party's knowledge, any uncured defaults on the part of the Requesting Party hereunder, and that the Responding Party has no defenses to or offsets against its obligations under this Lease, or specifying such defaults, defenses or offsets if any are claimed, (iii) certifying the date that Tenant entered into occupancy of the Premises, (iv) certifying the amount of the Basic Monthly Rental and the Rental payable under Paragraph 4(b) and the date to which Rental is paid in advance, if any, and certifying that Tenant is entitled to no rent abatement or other economic concessions not specified in the Lease (v) evidencing the status of this Lease as may be required either by a lender making a loan affecting, or a purchaser of, the Premises, the Building, the Real Property or any interest therein from Landlord or a Tenant's purchaser, investor, lender, or proposed transferee (vi) certifying the amount of the Deposit, if any, (vii) certifying that all Base Building Improvements to be constructed in the Premises by Landlord are completed (or specifying any obligations of Landlord respecting Improvements), and (viii) certifying such other matters relating to this Lease and/or the Premises as may be reasonably requested.

The Responding Party's failure to deliver said statement in the time required shall be conclusive upon the Responding Party that: (i) the Lease is in full force and effect, without modification except as may be represented by the Requesting Party, (ii) there are no uncured defaults in the Requesting Party's performance and the Responding Party has no right of offset, counterclaim or deduction against Rental under the Lease and (iii) no more than one month's Basic Monthly Rental has been paid in advance.
         (d) Financial Statements. At Landlord's request and in connection with the sale or financing of the Real Property, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord Tenant's financial statements ("Financial Statements") for the fiscal year of Tenant ended on the previous December 31, which Financial Statements shall include a combined balance sheet of Tenant and its combined subsidiaries as at the end of such fiscal year, a combined statement of operations of Tenant and its combined subsidiaries for such fiscal year, and a certificate of Tenant's auditor (or, if audited Financial Statements are not available, then a certificate of Tenant's Chief Financial Officer) to the effect that such Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and fairly present the financial condition and operations of Tenant and its combined subsidiaries for and as at the end of such fiscal year.
         (e) Right of Landlord To Perform. All terms and covenants of this Lease to be performed or observed by Tenant shall be performed or observed by Tenant at Tenant's expense and without any reduction of Rental. If Tenant fails to pay any Rental hereunder or fails to perform any other term or covenant hereunder on its part to be performed, and such failure shall continue for ten (10) days (or such shorter period as may be reasonable under emergency circumstances) after written notice thereof by Landlord, Landlord, without waiving or releasing Tenant from any obligation of Tenant hereunder, may make any such payment or perform any such other term or covenant on Tenant's part to be performed but shall not be obligated to do so. All sums so paid by Landlord and all necessary costs of such performance by Landlord, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate from the date of such payment or performance by Landlord, shall be paid (and Tenant covenants to make such payment) to Landlord on demand by Landlord, and Landlord shall have (in addition to any other right or remedy of Landlord) the same rights and remedies in the event of non payment thereof by Tenant as in the case of failure by Tenant in the payment of Rental hereunder.
         (f) Rules and Regulations. Tenant agrees to faithfully observe and to comply in all material respects with the Building Rules and Regulations attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by this reference, and all reasonable modifications of and additions thereto from time to time put into effect by Landlord which are applicable to all tenants of the Building and of which Tenant shall have notice. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant for the non performance by any other tenant or occupant of the Building of any of said Building Rules and Regulations; provided all such Building Rules and Regulations are non-discriminatory and evenly enforced and applied by Landlord In the event any of the Building Rules and Regulations conflict with any express provision of this Lease, the provisions of this Lease shall govern.
 
30

         (g) Attorneys' Fees. In case any suit or other proceeding shall be brought for an unlawful detainer of the Premises or for the recovery of any Rental due under the provisions of this Lease or because of the failure of performance or observance of any other term or covenant herein contained on the part of Landlord or Tenant, the unsuccessful party in such suit or proceeding shall pay to the prevailing party therein reasonable attorneys' fees and costs which shall include fees and costs of any appeal, all as fixed by the Court. If Landlord or Tenant should be named as a defendant in any suit brought against the other in connection with Tenant's occupancy of the Premises under this Lease, the party defendant primarily responsible for the bringing of such suit shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses incurred in such suit and reasonable attorneys' fees.
         (h) Intentionally Omitted.
         (i) Waiver. The failure of Landlord to object to or to assert any remedy by reason of Tenant's failure to perform or observe any covenant or term hereof or its failure to assert any rights by reason of the happening or non happening of any condition hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of its right to assert and enforce any remedy it may have by reason of such failure on the part of Tenant or the happening or non happening of such condition or a waiver of its rights to enforce any of its rights by reason of any subsequent failure of Tenant to perform or observe the same or any other term or covenant or by reason of the subsequent happening or non happening of the same or any other condition. No custom or practice which may develop between the parties hereto during the term hereof shall be deemed a waiver of, or in any way affect, the right of Landlord to insist upon performance and observance by Tenant in strict accordance with the terms hereof. The acceptance of Rental hereunder by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding failure of Tenant to perform or observe any term or covenant of this Lease, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular Rental so accepted, irrespective of any knowledge on the part of Landlord of such preceding failure at the time of acceptance of such Rental.
         (j) Light, Air and View. Tenant agrees that no diminution or shutting off of light, air or view by any structure which may be erected (whether or not by Landlord) on property adjacent to the Building shall in any way affect this Lease, entitle Tenant to any reduction of Rental hereunder or result in any liability of Landlord to Tenant. Landlord hereby represents that Landlord is not aware of any projects that are pending as of the date of this Lease that would diminish or obstruct light to or view from the Premises.
         (k) Notices. All notices, demands, requests, advices or designations ("Notices") which may be or are required to be given by either party to the other hereunder shall be in writing. All Notices by Landlord to Tenant shall be sufficiently given, made or delivered if personally delivered to Tenant by leaving the same at the Premises, or if sent by United States certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, addressed to Tenant at Tenant's address for notices as set forth in the Summary of Lease Terms. All Notices by Tenant to Landlord shall be sufficiently given, made or delivered if personally delivered on Landlord, or sent by United States certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, addressed to Landlord at Landlord's address for notices specified in Paragraph B of the Summary of Lease Terms. Each Notice shall be deemed received on the date of the personal service or three (3) days after the mailing thereof, in the manner herein provided, as the case may be.
 
31

         (1) Name.

         If Landlord shall have given such consent to any tenant at any time, whether before or after the execution of the Lease, such consent shall in no way operate as a waiver or release of any of the provisions hereof or of such Lease, and shall be deemed to relate only to the particular sign, placard, picture, name, advertisement or notice so consented to by Landlord and shall not be construed as dispensing with the necessity of obtaining the specific written consent of Landlord with respect to any other such sign, placard, picture, name, advertisement or notice.
