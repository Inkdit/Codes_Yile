operate the same in a manner consistent with that of other first-class, office
buildings located in the Gateway submarket of Phoenix, Arizona, which buildings
are comparable in size, age, specifications, construction and quality of
appearance, services and amenities to the Building (the "Comparable Buildings"),
and the use thereof shall be subject to such rules, regulations and restrictions
as Landlord may make from time to time. Landlord reserves the right to close
temporarily, make alterations or additions to, or change the location of
elements of the Project and the Common Areas, provided that such action does not
materially and unreasonably interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises.

               1.1.4 ACCESS. Subject to those provisions of this Lease which
specify to the contrary, Tenant shall have full and unimpaired access to the
Premises, the Building, the Project (including the parking lot) and the Common
Areas (including the Building elevators).

        The terms and provisions of this Lease shall be effective as of the date
of this Lease. The term of this Lease (the "Lease Term") shall be as set forth
in Section 3.1 of the Summary, shall commence on the date set forth in Section
3.2 of the Summary (the "Lease Commencement Date"), and shall terminate on the

        Tenant shall pay, without prior notice or demand, to Landlord or
Landlord's agent at the management office of the Project, or, at Landlord's
option, at such other place as Landlord may from time to time designate in

for private or public debts in the United States of America, base rent ("BASE
RENT") as set forth in Section 4 of the Summary, payable in equal monthly

the first day of each and every calendar month during the Lease Term. The Base
Rent for the first full month of the Lease Term which occurs after the
expiration of any free rent period shall be paid at the time of Tenant's
execution of this Lease. If any Rent payment date (including the Lease
Commencement Date) falls on a day of the month other than the first day of such
month or if any payment of Rent is for a period which is shorter than one month,
the Rent for any fractional month shall accrue on a daily basis for the period
from the date such payment is due to the end of such calendar month or to the
end of the Lease Term at a rate per day which is equal to 1/365 of the
applicable annual Rent. All other

Expenses for the calendar year [ * ] as to the second floor of the Premises, and
[ * ] as to the first floor of the Premises, calculated, as more specifically
set forth in the last paragraph of Section 4.2.7 below, utilizing a gross-up

to the Lease Commencement Date and was of such a nature that a federal, State or
municipal governmental authority, if it had then had knowledge of the presence
of such hazardous material, in the state, and under the conditions that it then
existed in the Building or on the Project, would have then required the removal
of such Hazardous Materials or other remedial or containment action with respect
thereto; and costs incurred to remove, remedy, contain, or treat hazardous
material, which Hazardous Materials is brought into the Building or onto the
Project after the date hereof by Landlord or any other tenant of the Project and

        (u) rental under any ground or underlying lease;

        (x) penalties or other costs incurred due to a violation by Landlord, as

that would have been incurred by Landlord absent such violation;

        (y) payments to subsidiaries or affiliates of Landlord for management or
other services on or to the Building or Project for supplies or other materials
to the extent that the cost of such services, supplies or materials materially
exceed the amounts normally payable to unaffiliated third parties for similar
goods and services under similar circumstances (taking into account the market
factors in effect on the date any relevant contracts were negotiated) in
comparable buildings;

        (z) all direct or indirect costs of refinancing, selling or exchanging
the Building or Project, including broker commissions, attorneys' fees and
closing costs; and

        (aa) costs arising from latent defects in the Base, Shell or Core of the
Building or improvements installed by Landlord or repair thereof.

        (bb) costs arising from the installation of canopy covers and other

        If Landlord is not furnishing any particular work or service (the cost
of which, if performed by Landlord, would be included in Operating Expenses) to
a tenant who has undertaken to perform such work or service in lieu of the
performance thereof by Landlord, Operating Expenses shall be deemed to be
increased by an amount equal to the additional Operating Expenses which would
reasonably have been incurred during such period by Landlord if it had at its
own expense furnished such work or service to such tenant. Landlord shall not
interpret the provisions of the preceding sentence in a manner which shall
increase Operating Expenses payable by Tenant under this Lease. If the Project
is not at least one hundred percent (100%) occupied during all or a portion of
any Expense Year, Landlord shall make an appropriate adjustment to the
components of Operating Expenses for such year to determine the amount of
Operating Expenses that would have been incurred had the Project been one
hundred percent (100%) occupied; and the amount so determined shall be deemed to
have been the amount of Operating Expenses for such year. Operating Expenses for
the Expense Year shall not


                                      -10-
<PAGE>   14

include market-wide labor-rate increases due to extraordinary circumstances,
including, but not limited to, boycotts and strikes, and utility rate increases
due to extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, conservation
surcharges, boycotts, embargoes or other shortages, or amortized costs relating
to capital improvements. For any charge or cost which Tenant is obligated to pay
under this Lease, no such charge or cost item shall be included more than once
or allocated under more than one expense category. The aggregate sum of all cost
items allocable to tenants or occupants of the Building for any year upon which
an allocation is made shall not exceed the aggregate sum of such expense items
which are actually incurred by Landlord in the year in question. For the
purposes of this Article 4, "variable components" include only those component
expenses that are affected by variations in occupancy levels.

               4.2.8 TAXES.

                      4.2.8.1 "TAX EXPENSES" shall mean all federal, state,
county, or local governmental or municipal taxes, fees, charges or other
impositions of every kind and nature, whether general, special, ordinary or
extraordinary, (including, without limitation, real estate taxes, general and
special assessments, transit taxes, personal property taxes imposed upon the
fixtures, machinery, equipment, apparatus, systems and equipment, appurtenances,
furniture and other personal property used in connection with the Project, or
any portion thereof), which shall be paid or accrued during any Expense Year
(without regard to any different fiscal year used by such governmental or
municipal authority) because of or in connection with the ownership, leasing and
operation of the Project, or any portion thereof, exclusive of any tax which
Tenant is required to pay under Section 4.5.3 or for which Landlord receives a
waiver.

                      4.2.8.2 Tax Expenses shall include, without limitation:
(i) Any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge in addition to, or in substitution,
partially or totally, of any assessment, tax, fee, levy or charge previously
included within the definition of real property tax; (ii) Any assessment, tax,
fee, levy or charge, upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a
party, creating or transferring an interest or an estate in the Premises; and
(iii) All of the real estate taxes and assessments imposed upon or with respect
to the Building and all of the real estate taxes and assessments imposed on the
land and improvements comprising the Project. Such Tax Expenses shall
specifically exclude (i) all excess profits taxes, franchise taxes, gift taxes,
capital stock taxes, inheritance and succession taxes, estate taxes, federal and
state income taxes, and other taxes applied or measured by Landlord's general or
net income (as opposed to rent, receipts, or income attributable to operations
at the Building), (ii) any item included in Operating Expenses, (iii) any tax
which Tenant is required to pay under Section 4.5.3; and (iv) any item for which
Landlord receives a waiver.

                      4.2.8.3 Any costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees) incurred in attempting
to protest, reduce or minimize Tax Expenses shall be included in Tax Expenses in
the Expense Year such expenses are incurred. If Tax Expenses for any period
during the Lease Term or any extension thereof are increased after payment
thereof for any reason, including, without limitation, error or reassessment by
applicable governmental or municipal authorities, Tenant shall pay Landlord upon
demand Tenant's Share of any such increased Tax Expenses included by Landlord as
Building Tax Expenses pursuant to the terms of this Lease. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.2.8 (except as set forth in
Section 4.2.8.1, above), there shall be


                                      -11-
<PAGE>   15

excluded from Tax Expenses (i) all excess profits taxes, franchise taxes, gift
taxes, capital stock taxes, inheritance and succession taxes, estate taxes,
federal and state income taxes, and other taxes to the extent applicable to
Landlord's general or net income (as opposed to rents, receipts or income
attributable to operations at the Project), (ii) any items included as Operating
Expenses, and (iii) any items paid by Tenant under Section 4.5 of this Lease.

                      4.2.8.4 The amount of Tax Expenses for the Expense Year
attributable to the valuation of the Project, inclusive of tenant improvements,
shall be known as the "Base Taxes". If in any comparison year subsequent to the
Expense Year, the amount of Tax Expenses decreases below the amount of Base
Taxes, then for purposes of all subsequent comparison years, including the
comparison year in which such decrease in Tax Expenses occurred, the Base Taxes,
and therefore the Expense Year, shall be decreased by an amount equal to the
decrease in Tax Expenses.

                      4.2.8.5 For the purposes of this Lease, Tax Expenses shall
be calculated as if the tenant improvements in the Building were fully
constructed and the real property, the Building, and all tenant improvements in
the Building were fully assessed for real estate tax purposes. Landlord
specifically agrees that the gross-receipts component of Tax Expenses for the
Base Year and each subsequent year shall be calculated as if the Building were
one hundred percent (100%) occupied with rent paying tenants.

               4.2.9 "TENANT'S SHARE" shall mean the percentage set forth in
Section 6 of the Summary. Tenant's Share was calculated based on the ratio of
the rentable square footage of the Premises to the total rentable square footage
of the Building. The rentable square feet in the Premises and Building is
measured pursuant to the Standard Method for Measuring Floor Area in Office
Buildings, ANSI Z65.1 - 1996 ("BOMA"), provided that the rentable square footage
of the Building shall include all of, and the rentable square footage of the
Premises therefore shall include a portion of, the square footage of the ground
floor common areas located within the Building and the common area and occupied
space of the portion of the Building or Project, dedicated to the service of the
Building. Not later than thirty (30) days following the Lease Commencement Date,
Landlord and Tenant shall remeasure the Premises to confirm the accuracy of the
measure of the rentable square footage. Any difference between the results
determined by such remeasurement shall be reflected on EXHIBIT C.

        4.3 METHOD OF ALLOCATION OF DIRECT EXPENSES. Landlord and Tenant
acknowledge that the Building is a part of a multi-building project and that the
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Project (i.e. the Direct
Expenses) should be shared between the tenants of the Building and the tenants
of the other buildings in the Project. Accordingly, as set forth in Section 4.2
above, Direct Expenses (which consists of Operating Expenses and Tax Expenses)
are determined annually for the Project as a whole, and a portion of the Direct
Expenses, which portion shall be determined by Landlord on an equitable basis,
shall be allocated to the tenants of the Building (as opposed to the tenants of
any other buildings in the Project) and such portion shall be the Building
Direct Expenses for purposes of this Lease. Such portion of Direct Expenses
allocated to the tenants of the Building shall include all Direct Expenses
attributable solely to the Building and an equitable portion of the Direct
Expenses attributable to the Project as a whole.


                                      -12-
<PAGE>   16

        4.4 CALCULATION AND PAYMENT OF ADDITIONAL RENT. If for any Expense Year
ending or commencing within the Lease Term, Tenant's Share of Building Direct
Expenses for such Expense Year exceeds Tenant's Share of Building Direct
Expenses applicable to the Base Year, then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, in the
manner set forth in Section 4.4.1, below, and as Additional Rent, an amount
equal to the excess (the "Excess").

               4.4.1 STATEMENT OF ACTUAL BUILDING DIRECT EXPENSES AND PAYMENT BY
TENANT. Landlord shall endeavor to give to Tenant following the end of each
Expense Year, a statement (the "STATEMENT") which shall state the Building
Direct Expenses incurred or accrued for such preceding Expense Year, and which
shall indicate the amount of the Excess. Upon receipt of the Statement for each
Expense Year commencing or ending during the Lease Term, if an Excess is
present, Tenant shall pay, with its next installment of Base Rent due, the full
amount of the Excess for such Expense Year, less the amounts, if any, paid
during such Expense Year as "Estimated Excess," as that term is defined in
Section 4.4.2, below, and if Tenant paid more as Estimated Excess than the
actual Excess, Tenant shall receive a credit in the amount of Tenant's
overpayment against Rent next due under this Lease. The failure of Landlord to
timely furnish the Statement for any Expense Year shall not prejudice Landlord
or Tenant from enforcing its rights under this Article 4. Even though the Lease
Term has expired and Tenant has vacated the Premises, when the final
determination is made of Tenant's Share of Building Direct Expenses for the
Expense Year in which this Lease terminates, if an Excess is present, Tenant
shall immediately pay to Landlord such amount, and if Tenant paid more as
Estimated Excess than the actual Excess, Landlord shall, within thirty (30)
days, deliver a check payable to Tenant in the amount of the overpayment. The
provisions of this Section 4.4.1 shall survive the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease Term.

               4.4.2 STATEMENT OF ESTIMATED BUILDING DIRECT EXPENSES. In
addition, Landlord shall endeavor to give Tenant a yearly expense estimate
statement (the "ESTIMATE STATEMENT") which shall set forth Landlord's reasonable
estimate (the "ESTIMATE") of what the total amount of Building Direct Expenses
for the then-current Expense Year shall be and the estimated excess (the
"ESTIMATED EXCESS") as calculated by comparing the Building Direct Expenses for
such Expense Year, which shall be based upon the Estimate, to the amount of
Building Direct Expenses for the Base Year. The failure of Landlord to timely
furnish the Estimate Statement for any Expense Year shall not preclude Landlord
from enforcing its rights to collect any Estimated Excess under this Article 4,
nor shall Landlord be prohibited from revising any Estimate Statement or
Estimated Excess theretofore delivered to the extent necessary. Thereafter,
Tenant shall pay, with its next installment of Base Rent due, a fraction of the
Estimated Excess for the then-current Expense Year (reduced by any amounts paid
pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 4.4.2). Such fraction shall have
as its numerator the number of months which have elapsed in such current Expense
Year, including the month of such payment, and twelve (12) as its denominator.
Until a new Estimate Statement is furnished (which Landlord shall have the right
to deliver to Tenant at any time), Tenant shall pay monthly, with the monthly
Base Rent installments, an amount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the total
Estimated Excess set forth in the previous Estimate Statement delivered by
Landlord to Tenant.

        4.5 TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES FOR WHICH TENANT IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE.

               4.5.1 Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay ten (10) days
before delinquency, taxes levied against Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures
and any other personal property located in or about the Premises. If any such
taxes on Tenant's equipment, furniture, fixtures and any other personal property
are levied against Landlord or Landlord's property or if the assessed value of
Landlord's property is increased by the inclusion therein of a value placed upon
such equipment, furniture, fixtures or any other personal property and if
Landlord pays the taxes based upon such increased assessment, which Landlord
shall have the right to do regardless of the validity thereof but only under
proper protest if requested by Tenant, Tenant shall upon demand repay to
Landlord the taxes so levied against Landlord or the proportion of such taxes
resulting from such increase in the assessment, as the case may be.

               4.5.2 Tenant shall be treated, economically, as if the provisions
of this Section 4.5.2 were included in all leases within the Project. If the
tenant improvements in the Premises, whether installed and/or paid for by
Landlord or Tenant and whether or not affixed to the real property so as to
become a part thereof, are assessed for real property tax purposes at a
valuation higher than the valuation at which tenant improvements conforming to
Landlord's "building standard" in other space in the Building are assessed, then
the Tax Expenses levied against Landlord or the property by reason of such
excess assessed valuation shall be deemed to be taxes levied against personal
property of Tenant and shall be governed by the provisions of Section 4.5.1,
above.

               4.5.3 Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, and
notwithstanding the fact that this Lease is a "Base Year" Lease, Tenant shall
pay, together with and in addition to the Base Rent specified in this Lease,
prior to delinquency, a sum equal to the aggregate of any municipal, city,
county, state or federal excise, sales, use or transaction privilege taxes
legally levied or imposed, or hereafter legally levied or imposed, during the
term hereof or any extension or renewal hereof, against or on account of any or
all amounts payable hereunder by Tenant or the receipt thereof by Landlord
(except state, federal or any other income taxes imposed or levied against
Landlord), including by way of illustration and not limitation any (i) rent tax
or sales tax, service tax, transfer tax or value added tax, or any other
applicable tax on the rent or services herein or otherwise respecting this
Lease, (ii) taxes assessed upon or with respect to the possession, leasing,
operation, management, maintenance, alteration, repair, use or occupancy by
Tenant of the Premises or any portion of the Project, including the Project
parking facility; or (iii) taxes assessed upon this transaction or any document
to which Tenant is a party creating or transferring an interest or an estate in
the Premises.

        4.6 CONTROLLABLE COSTS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Article 4, for each Expense Year, Tenant's obligation to pay
"Controllable Costs" (as hereinafter defined) shall not increase, on an annual
and cumulative basis, by an amount greater than [*] per year
following the initial lease year. For purposes of this Section 4.6,
"Controllable Costs" shall mean all Operating Expenses and Tax Expenses except:
(i) property taxes and any and all assessments, including assessment districts,
and government mandated charges with respect to the Building or Project, or any
part thereof; (ii) insurance carried by Landlord with respect to the Project
and/or the operation thereof; and (iii) costs of utilities, including, without
limitation, air conditioning, heating, ventilating, plumbing, and electricity

* Portions redacted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment

costs, water and sewer charges, utility surcharges or assessments and refuse
removal. Such limitations shall be calculated on an annual basis and cumulative
basis only, such that Landlord may carry forward increases in Controllable
Operating Expenses in excess of one hundred five percent (105%) and pass them
through to Tenant in subsequent Expense Years so long as the requirements of the
preceding sentence are satisfied.

        4.7 LANDLORD'S BOOKS AND RECORDS. Within forty-five (45) days after
receipt of a Statement by Tenant, if Tenant disputes the amount of Additional
Rent set forth in the Statement, a representative, designated by Tenant, may,
after reasonable notice to Landlord and at reasonable times, inspect Landlord's
records at Landlord's offices, provided that Tenant is not then in a state of
monetary default after the applicable cure period has lapsed under this Lease.
If Tenant disputes a line-item amount in the Statement, Tenant may request a
copy of the supporting documents relating to such line-item. If after such
inspection, Tenant still disputes the amount of the Additional Rent set forth in
the statement, Tenant shall have the right, within the ninety (90) days
thereafter, to cause an independent certified public accountant (which
consultant is a member of a regionally recognized accounting firm), as selected
by Tenant and reasonably approved by Landlord (the "Accountant"), to commence
and complete an audit of Landlord's books and records to determine the proper
amount of the Additional Rent payable by Tenant for the Expense Year which is
the subject of such statement, which audit shall be final and binding upon
Landlord and Tenant. If such audit reveals that Landlord has overcharged Tenant,
then Landlord shall credit against Tenant's rental obligations next falling due
the amount of such over-charge with interest at the Interest Rate. If the audit
reveals that the Tenant was under-charged, then within thirty (30) days after
the results of such audit are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall reimburse
to Landlord the amount of such under-charge with interest at the Interest Rate.
Tenant shall pay the costs of such audit unless the Accountant determines that
the amount of Additional Rent set forth in the Statement which was the subject
of such audit was in error to Tenant's disadvantage by more than [*] of the
Operating Expenses and Tax Expenses, in which case Landlord shall pay the cost
of such audit.

                                    ARTICLE 5

                                 USE OF PREMISES

        5.1 PERMITTED USE. Tenant shall use the Premises solely for the
Permitted Use set forth in Section 7 of the Summary and Tenant shall not use or
permit the Premises or the Project to be used for any other purpose or purposes
whatsoever without the prior written consent of Landlord, which may be withheld
in Landlord's sole discretion.

        5.2 PROHIBITED USES. Tenant further covenants and agrees that Tenant
shall not use, or suffer or permit any person or persons to use, the Premises or
any part thereof for any use or purpose contrary to the provisions of the "Rules
and Regulations" set forth in EXHIBIT D, attached hereto, or in violation of the
laws of the United States of America, the State of Arizona, or the ordinances,
regulations or requirements of the local municipal or county governing body or
other lawful authorities having jurisdiction over the Project, including,
without limitation, any such laws, ordinances, regulations or requirements
relating to hazardous materials or substances, as those terms are defined by
applicable laws now or hereafter in effect. Landlord shall not modify the Rules
and Regulations without Tenant's consent, which shall not be unreasonably

withheld or delayed, and which consent shall be deemed to be granted by Tenant
so long as such change shall not require Tenant to pay Additional Rent and shall
not unreasonably interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises. Such amendment is
not binding on Tenant until the tenth (10th) business day after Tenant receives
written notice of the change, and no rule shall apply retroactively. The Rules
and Regulations do not take precedence over the specific terms and conditions of
the lease. Tenant shall not do or permit anything to be done in or about the
Premises which will in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of other
tenants or occupants of the Building, or injure or annoy them or use or allow
the Premises to be used for any unlawful purpose, nor shall Tenant cause,
maintain or permit any nuisance in, on or about the Premises. Tenant shall
comply with, and Tenant's rights and obligations under the Lease and Tenant's
use of the Premises shall be subject and subordinate to, all recorded easements,
covenants, conditions, and restrictions now or hereafter affecting the Project,
provided that any such easements, covenants, conditions, and restrictions
hereafter affecting the Project do not materially and unreasonably interfere
with Tenant's use of the Premises and do not result in any additional monetary
obligation on the part of Tenant other than minor administrative compliance
costs.

        5.3 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.

               5.3.1 PROHIBITION ON USE. Tenant shall not use or allow another
person or entity to use any part of the Premises for the storage, use,
treatment, manufacture or sale of Hazardous Materials, except for such products
in the Premises which are incidental to the operation of its offices, such as
photocopy supplies, secretarial supplies and limited janitorial supplies, which
products contain chemicals which are categorized as Hazardous Materials.
Landlord agrees that the use of such products in the Premises in compliance with
all applicable laws and in the manner in which such products are designed to be
used shall not be a violation by Tenant of this Section 5.3.1.

               5.3.2 INDEMNITY. Subject to the provisions of Section 10.1 below,
Landlord and Tenant each agree to indemnify, defend, protect and hold the other
harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, administrative
proceedings (including informal proceedings), judgments, damages, punitive
damages, penalties, fines, costs, liabilities, interest or losses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, consultant fees, and expert fees,
together with all other costs and expenses of any kind or nature, that arise
during or after the Lease Term directly or indirectly from or in connection with
the presence, suspected presence, release or suspected release of any Hazardous
Materials in or into the air, soil, surface water or groundwater at, on, about,
under or within the Premises or Project or any portion thereof, caused by the
other party, its assignees or subtenants and/or their respective agents,
employees, contractors, licensees or invitees.

               5.3.3 REMEDIAL WORK. In the event any investigation or monitoring
of site conditions or any clean-up, containment, restoration, removal or other
remedial work (collectively, the "Remedial Work") is required under any
applicable federal, state or local laws or by any judicial order, or by any
governmental entity as the result of operations or activities upon, or any use
or occupancy of any portion of the Premises by Tenant or Tenant Affiliates,
Tenant shall perform or cause to be performed the Remedial Work in compliance
with such laws or order. All Remedial Work shall be performed by one or more
contractors, selected by Tenant


                                      -16-
<PAGE>   20

and approved in advance in writing by Landlord. All costs and expenses of such
Remedial Work shall be paid by Tenant, including, without limitation, the
charges of such contractor(s), the consulting engineers, and Landlord's
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with monitoring or
review of such Remedial Work.

               5.3.4 DEFINITION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. As used herein, the term
"Hazardous Materials" means any hazardous or toxic substance, material or waste
which is or becomes regulated by any local governmental authority, the State of
Arizona or the United States, including, without limitation, any material or
substance which is (i) defined or listed as a "hazardous waste," "extremely
hazardous waste," "restricted hazardous waste," "hazardous substance" or
"hazardous material" under any applicable federal, state or local law or
administrative code promulgated thereunder, (ii) petroleum products, (iii)

                                    ARTICLE 6

                             SERVICES AND UTILITIES

        6.1 STANDARD TENANT SERVICES. Tenant shall be allowed to use the
Premises on a twenty-four (24) hour seven (7) day per week basis. Landlord shall
provide the following services on all days (unless otherwise stated below)
during the Lease Term.

               6.1.1 Subject to limitations imposed by all governmental rules,
regulations and guidelines applicable thereto, and taking into account the fact
that the Premises have been improved with electronic monitoring systems which
program themselves rather than customary thermostats, Landlord shall provide
heating, ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") to the Premises in accordance
with that required for normal comfort, given the location of the Building in
Phoenix, Arizona, for normal office use and delivered to the Comparable
Buildings from 7:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Monday through Friday, and on Saturdays
from 8:00 A.M. to 12:00 Noon (collectively, the "BUILDING HOURS"), except for
the date of observation of New Year's Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Memorial
Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, President's
Day and, at Landlord's discretion, other locally or nationally recognized
holidays which are observed by other Comparable Buildings (collectively, the
"HOLIDAYS"). In the event that the Approved Working Drawings do not reflect HVAC
zoning controls or if Tenant desires to add or revise HVAC zoning controls
within the Premises during the Lease Term as an Alteration, Landlord hereby
approves the concept of HVAC zoning controls subject to its plan approval
requirements and other requirements relating to Alterations as set forth in
Article 8 of this Lease.

               6.1.2 Landlord shall provide adequate electrical wiring and
electricity for lighting and power in the Premises, provided that (i) the
connected electrical load of the incidental use equipment does not exceed an
average of five (5) watts per rentable square foot of the Premises, and the
electricity so furnished for incidental use equipment will be at a nominal one
hundred twenty (120) volts and no electrical circuit for the supply of such
incidental use equipment will require a current capacity exceeding twenty (20)
amperes, and (ii) the connected electrical load of Tenant's lighting fixtures
does not exceed an average of one (1) watt per usable


                                      -17-
<PAGE>   21

square foot of the Premises, and the electricity so furnished for Tenant's
lighting will be at a nominal two hundred seventy-seven (277) volts, which
electrical usage shall be subject to applicable laws and regulations. Tenant
shall bear the cost of replacement of lamps, starters and ballasts for
non-Building standard lighting fixtures within the Premises. Landlord shall be
responsible, as an Operating Expense for the ordinary, typical and routine
replacement of lamps, starts and ballasts for Building standard lighting
fixtures within the Premises.

               6.1.3 Landlord shall provide city water twenty-four (24) hours a
day, seven (7) days a week, from the regular Building outlets for drinking,
lavatory and toilet purposes in the Common Areas.

               6.1.4 Landlord shall provide janitorial services to the Premises
and Common Areas serving the Premises, Monday through Friday, except Holidays.
Such janitorial services shall be provided in a manner consistent with that
provided comparable first-class office buildings in the vicinity of the Project.
Landlord shall provide window washing services in a manner consistent with other
comparable buildings in the vicinity of the Building, but in no event less than
two (2) times per year. Tenant shall have the right to contract for additional
janitorial service, at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Landlord shall provide
landscaping maintenance for the Project in a manner consistent with that
provided comparable first-class office buildings in the vicinity of the Project.

               6.1.5 Landlord shall provide nonexclusive, non-attended automatic
passenger/freight elevator service, with all elevators in service (subject to
normal maintenance and repair) during the Building Hours, and shall have one
elevator available at all other times, including on the Holidays.

        Tenant shall cooperate fully with Landlord at all times and abide by all
regulations, procedures and requirements that Landlord may reasonably prescribe
for the proper functioning and protection of the HVAC, electrical, mechanical
and plumbing systems.

        6.2 OVERSTANDARD TENANT USE. Unless identified on plans approved by
Landlord prior to their installation, Tenant shall not, without Landlord's prior
written consent, use heat-generating machines, machines other than normal
fractional horsepower office machines, or equipment or lighting other than
Building standard lights in the Premises, which may affect the temperature
otherwise maintained by the air conditioning system or increase the water
normally furnished for the Premises by Landlord pursuant to the terms of Section
6.1 of this Lease. If Tenant uses water, electricity (including lighting), heat
or air conditioning in excess of that supplied by Landlord pursuant to Section
6.1 of this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, upon billing, the actual cost
of such excess consumption, the cost of the installation, operation, and
maintenance of equipment which is installed in order to supply such excess
consumption, and the cost of the increased wear and tear on existing equipment
caused by such excess consumption; and Landlord may install devices to
separately meter any increased use and in such event Tenant shall pay the
increased cost directly to Landlord, on demand, at the rates charged by the
public utility company furnishing the same, including the cost of such
additional metering devices. Tenant's use of electricity shall never exceed the
capacity of the feeders to the Project or the risers or wiring installation, and
subject to the terms of Section 29.32, below, Tenant shall not install or use or
permit the installation or use of any computer or electronic data processing


                                      -18-
<PAGE>   22

equipment (other than customary desktop personal computers and similar office
equipment) in the Premises (unless identified on plans approved by Landlord
prior to their installation), without the prior written consent of Landlord. If
Tenant desires to use heat, ventilation or air conditioning during hours other
than those for which Landlord is obligated to supply such utilities pursuant to
the terms of Section 6.1 of this Lease, Tenant shall give Landlord such prior
notice, if any, as Landlord shall from time to time establish as appropriate, of
Tenant's desired use in order to supply such utilities, and Landlord shall
supply such utilities to Tenant at such actual cost to Tenant (which shall be
treated as Additional Rent) as Landlord shall from time to time establish.
Tenant's data center (the "Data Center"), as well as all other portions of the
Premises so designated on the plans, shall be separately metered.

        6.3 INTERRUPTION OF USE. Tenant agrees that Landlord shall not be liable
for damages, by abatement of Rent or otherwise, for failure to furnish or delay
in furnishing any service (including telephone and telecommunication services),
or for any diminution in the quality or quantity thereof, when such failure or
delay or diminution is occasioned, in whole or in part, by breakage, repairs,
replacements, or improvements, by any strike, lockout or other labor trouble, by
inability to secure electricity, gas, water, or other fuel at the Building or
Project after reasonable effort to do so, by any riot or other dangerous
condition, emergency, accident or casualty whatsoever, by act or default of
Tenant or other parties, or by any other cause beyond Landlord's reasonable
control; and such failures or delays or diminution shall never be deemed to
constitute an eviction or disturbance of Tenant's use and possession of the
Premises or relieve Tenant from paying Rent or performing any of its obligations
under this Lease; however, notwithstanding Section 29.16, and without limiting
Tenant's remedies hereunder or at law or equity, Landlord agrees that in the
event such interruption prevents Tenant from using some or all of the Premise
and such interruption continues for five (5) days after Landlord's receipt of
notice of same, then Tenant shall be entitled to one (1) day of abated Rent (or
prorated abated Rent if Tenant is using a portion of the Premises) for every one
(1) day which any of the utilities or services described in Section 6.1
generally are not provided to the Premises and the Premises are not occupied by
Tenant as a result thereof, such abatement to be in proportion to the ratio that
the amount of rentable square feet of the Premises which is unfit for occupancy
for the purposes permitted under this Lease bears to the total rentable square
feet of the Premises. If such interruption continues for a period of more than
ninety (90) consecutive days, then Tenant may, at any point after the expiration
of such ninety (90) day period, and so long as such interruption is then
continuing, terminate this Lease and Tenant's remaining obligations hereunder.
Furthermore, Landlord shall not be liable under any circumstances for a loss of,
or injury to, property or for injury to, or interference with, Tenant's
business, including, without limitation, loss of profits, however occurring,
through or in connection with or incidental to a failure to furnish any of the
services or utilities as set forth in this Article 6.

                                    ARTICLE 7

                                     REPAIRS

        Tenant shall, at Tenant's own expense, keep the Premises, including all
improvements, fixtures and furnishings therein, and the non-structural floor or
floors of the Building in which the Premises are located, in good order, repair
and condition at all times during the Lease Term. In addition, Tenant shall, at
Tenant's own expense, but under the supervision and subject to the


                                      -19-
<PAGE>   23

prior approval of Landlord, and within any reasonable period of time specified
by Landlord, promptly and adequately repair all damage to the Premises and
replace or repair all damaged, broken, or worn fixtures and appurtenances caused
by Tenant's use of the Premises except for damage caused by ordinary wear and
tear or beyond the reasonable control of Tenant; provided however, that, if
Tenant fails to make such repairs, Landlord may, but need not, make such repairs
and replacements, and Tenant shall pay Landlord the cost thereof, including a
percentage of the cost thereof (to be uniformly, nondiscriminatorily, and
reasonably established for the Building and/or the Project) sufficient to
reimburse Landlord for all overhead, general conditions, fees and other costs or
expenses arising from Landlord's control of such repairs and replacements
forthwith upon being billed for same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord
shall be responsible for compliance with the American Disabilities Act with
respect to the portions of the Building and Project located outside of the
perimeter of the Premises, and Tenant shall be responsible for compliance with
such Act during the term of the Lease to the extent of its applications to the
area located within the perimeter of the Premises, unless any noncompliance with
such Act within the Premises is a condition which existed due to the design and
construction of the "Base, Shell and Core" as defined in Section 1.1 of EXHIBIT
B to this Lease. Landlord shall also be responsible for repairs to the exterior
walls, foundation and roof of the Building, the structural portions of the
floors of the Building, the systems and equipment of the Building, and the
landscaping, walkways, driveways and parking areas of the Project, except to the
extent that such repairs are required due to the negligence or willful
misconduct of Tenant; provided, however, that if such repairs are due to the
negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant, Landlord shall nevertheless make
such repairs at Tenant's expense. Subject to the limitations of Article 27,
Landlord may, but shall not be required to, enter the Premises at all reasonable
times to make such repairs, alterations, improvements or additions to the
Premises or to the Project or to any equipment located in the Project as
Landlord shall reasonably deem necessary or as Landlord may be required to do by
governmental or quasi-governmental authority or court order or decree. TENANT
HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS UNDER AND BENEFITS OF ARIZONA REVISED STATUTES
SECTION 33-343 OR UNDER ANY SIMILAR LAW, STATUTE, OR ORDINANCE NOW OR HEREAFTER
IN EFFECT.

                                    ARTICLE 8

                            ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS

        8.1 LANDLORD'S CONSENT TO ALTERATIONS. Tenant may not make any
improvements, alterations or additions to the Premises or any mechanical,
plumbing or HVAC facilities or systems pertaining to the Premises (collectively,
the "ALTERATIONS") without first procuring the prior written consent of Landlord
to such Alterations, which consent shall be requested by Tenant not less than
five (5) days prior to the commencement thereof, and which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed by Landlord, provided it shall be deemed
reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any Alteration which
adversely affects the structural portions or the systems or equipment of the
Building or is visible from the exterior of the Building. The construction of
the initial improvements to the Premises shall be governed by the terms of the
Tenant Work Letter and not the terms of this Article 8.

        8.2 MANNER OF CONSTRUCTION. Landlord may impose, as a condition of its
consent to any and all Alterations or repairs of the Premises or about the
Premises, such requirements as


                                      -20-
<PAGE>   24

Landlord in its discretion may deem desirable, including, but not limited to,
the requirement that Tenant utilize for such purposes only contractors,
subcontractors, materials, mechanics and materialmen approved by Landlord, the
requirement that upon Landlord's request, Tenant shall, at Tenant's expense,
remove such Alterations upon the expiration or any early termination of the
Lease Term. At the time of approval of any such alteration, Landlord shall
advise Tenant whether or not Landlord shall require Tenant to remove such
alteration at the end of the Lease Term. Tenant shall construct such Alterations
and perform such repairs in a good and workmanlike manner, in conformance with
any and all applicable federal, state, county or municipal laws, rules and
regulations and pursuant to a valid building permit, issued by the city in which
the Project is located, all in conformance with Landlord's construction rules
and regulations; provided, however, that prior to commencing to construct any
Alteration, Tenant shall meet with Landlord to discuss Landlord's design
parameters and code compliance issues. In the event Tenant performs any
Alterations in the Premises which require or give rise to governmentally
required changes to the "BASE BUILDING," as that term is defined below, then
Landlord shall, at Tenant's expense, make such changes to the Base Building. The
"Base Building" shall include the structural portions of the Building, and the
public restrooms, elevators, exit stairwells and the systems and equipment
located in the internal core of the Building on the floor or floors on which the
Premises are located. In performing the work of any such Alterations, Tenant
shall have the work performed in such manner so as not to obstruct access to the
Project or any portion thereof, by any other tenant of the Project, and so as
not to obstruct the business of Landlord or other tenants in the Project. In
addition to Tenant's obligations under Article 9 of this Lease, upon completion
of any Alterations, Tenant agrees to cause a Notice of Completion to be recorded
in the office of the Recorder of the County in which the Project is located in
accordance with ARIZONA REVISED STATUTES Section 33-993(E) or any successor
statute, and Tenant shall deliver to the Project construction manager a copy of
the "field-grade as-built" drawings of the Alterations as well as all permits,
approvals and other documents issued by any governmental agency in connection
with the Alterations.

        8.3 PAYMENT FOR IMPROVEMENTS. If payment is made directly to
contractors, Tenant shall (i) comply with Landlord's requirements for final lien
releases and waivers in connection with Tenant's payment for work to
contractors, and (ii) sign Landlord's standard contractor's rules and
regulations which shall be typical and customary of the contractors rules and
regulations promulgated by institutional owners of the Comparable Buildings. If
Tenant orders any work directly from Landlord, Tenant shall enter into a
construction agreement with Landlord which shall define Landlord's construction
costs, overhead and fee. If Tenant does not order any work directly from
Landlord, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for Landlord's reasonable, actual,
out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred in connection with Landlord's
review of such work.

        8.4 CONSTRUCTION INSURANCE. In addition to the requirements of Article
10 of this Lease, in the event that Tenant makes any Alterations, prior to the
commencement of such Alterations, Tenant shall provide Landlord with evidence
that Tenant carries "Builder's All Risk" insurance in an amount approved by
Landlord covering the construction of such Alterations, and such other insurance
as Landlord may reasonably require, it being understood and agreed that all of
such Alterations shall be insured by Tenant pursuant to Article 10 of this Lease
immediately upon completion thereof.

        8.5 LANDLORD'S PROPERTY.

               8.5.1 REMOVAL OBLIGATIONS. All Alterations, improvements,
fixtures, equipment and/or appurtenances which may be installed or placed in or
about the Premises, from time to time, shall be at the sole cost of Tenant and
shall be and become the property of Landlord, except that Tenant may remove any
Alterations, improvements, fixtures and/or equipment which Landlord agreed that
Tenant could remove upon the surrender of the Premises, provided Tenant repairs
any damage to the Premises and Building caused by such removal and returns the
affected portion of the Premises to a building standard tenant improved
condition as determined by Landlord. The following is an itemized list of
Tenant's fixtures which Tenant shall be entitled to remove at the end of the
Lease Term to the extent such items have not been acquired utilizing the Tenant
Improvement Allowance.

               8.5.2 REMOVAL OBLIGATIONS. Furthermore, Landlord may, by written
notice to Tenant prior to the end of the Lease Term, or given following any
earlier termination of this Lease, require Tenant, at Tenant's expense, to
remove any Alterations or improvements and to repair any damage to the Premises
and Building caused by such removal and return the affected portion of the
Premises to a building standard tenant improved condition as determined by
Landlord. If Tenant fails to complete such removal and/or to repair any damage
caused by the removal of any Alterations or improvements in the Premises and
return the affected portion of


                                      -22-
<PAGE>   26

the Premises to a building standard tenant improved condition as reasonably
determined by Landlord, Landlord may do so and may charge the cost thereof to
Tenant. Tenant hereby protects, defends, indemnifies and holds Landlord harmless
from any liability, cost, obligation, expense or claim of lien in any manner
relating to the installation, placement, removal or financing of any such
Alterations, improvements, fixtures and/or equipment in, on or about the
Premises, which obligations of Tenant shall survive the expiration or earlier
termination of this Lease.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                             COVENANT AGAINST LIENS

        Tenant shall keep the Project and Premises free from any liens or
encumbrances arising out of the work performed, materials furnished or
obligations incurred by or on behalf of Tenant, and shall protect, defend,
indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any claims, liabilities,
judgments or costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs) arising out of same or in connection therewith. Tenant shall give
Landlord notice at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of any such
work on the Premises (or such additional time as may be necessary under
applicable laws) to afford Landlord the opportunity of posting and recording
appropriate notices of non-responsibility. Tenant shall remove any such lien or
encumbrance by bond or otherwise within ten (10) business days after notice by
Landlord, and if Tenant shall fail to do so, Landlord may pay the amount
necessary to remove such lien or encumbrance, without being responsible for
investigating the validity thereof, unless Tenant has commenced legal action to
contest, dispute, or defend the claims of the lienholder and the validity of the
liens and thereafter continues to prosecute this action to a successful judgment
releasing the lienholder's interest in the Premises or the Building. The amount
so paid shall be deemed Additional Rent under this Lease payable upon demand,
without limitation as to other remedies available to Landlord under this Lease.
Nothing contained in this Lease shall authorize Tenant to do any act which shall
subject Landlord's title to the Building or Premises to any liens or
encumbrances whether claimed by operation of law or express or implied contract.
Any claim to a lien or encumbrance upon the Building or Premises arising in
connection with any such work or respecting the Premises not performed by or at
the request of Landlord shall be null and void, or at Landlord's option shall
attach only against Tenant's interest in the Premises and shall in all respects
be subordinate to Landlord's title to the Project, Building and Premises.

                                   ARTICLE 10

                                    INSURANCE

        10.1 INDEMNIFICATION AND WAIVER. Tenant hereby assumes all risk of
damage to property or injury to persons in, upon or about the Premises from any
cause whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any personal injuries resulting
from a slip and fall in, upon or about the Premises) and agrees that Landlord,
its partners, subpartners and their respective officers, agents, servants,
employees, and independent contractors (collectively, "LANDLORD PARTIES") shall
not be liable for, and are hereby released from any responsibility for, any
damage either to person or property or resulting from the loss of use thereof,
which damage is sustained by Tenant or by other persons claiming through Tenant.
Tenant shall indemnify, defend, protect,


                                      -23-
<PAGE>   27

and hold harmless the Landlord Parties from any and all loss, cost, damage,
expense and liability (including without limitation court costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with or arising from any cause in, on or
about the Premises (including, but not limited to, a slip and fall), any acts,
omissions or negligence of Tenant or of any person claiming by, through or under
Tenant, or of the contractors, agents, servants, employees, invitees, guests or
licensees of Tenant or any such person, in, on or about the Project or any
breach of the terms of this Lease, either prior to, during, or after the
expiration of the Lease Term, provided that the terms of the foregoing indemnity
shall not apply to the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord. Should
Landlord be named as a defendant in any suit brought against Tenant in
connection with or arising out of Tenant's occupancy of the Premises, Tenant
shall pay to Landlord its costs and expenses incurred in such suit, including
without limitation, its actual professional fees such as reasonable appraisers',
accountants' and attorneys' fees. The provisions of this Section 10.1 shall
survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease with respect to any
claims or liability arising in connection with any event occurring prior to such
expiration or termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Lease, nothing in this Lease shall impose any obligations on Tenant or
Landlord to be responsible or liable for, and each hereby releases the other
from all liability for, consequential damages other than those consequential
damages incurred by Landlord in connection with a holdover of the Premises by
Tenant after the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease or incurred by
Landlord in connection with any repair, physical construction or improvement
work performed by or on behalf of Tenant in the Project, but Tenant shall not be
responsible for any direct or consequential damages resulting from Landlord's or
contractor's acts in connection with the completion by Landlord of the tenant
improvements in the Premises pursuant to the Tenant Work Letter.

        10.2 TENANT'S COMPLIANCE WITH LANDLORD'S FIRE AND CASUALTY INSURANCE.
Tenant shall comply with all non-monetary insurance company requirements
pertaining to the use of the Premises. If Tenant's conduct or use of the
Premises causes any increase in the premium for such insurance policies then
Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any such increase. Tenant, at Tenant's
expense, shall comply with all rules, orders, regulations or requirements of the
American Insurance Association (formerly the National Board of Fire
Underwriters) and with any similar body.

        10.3 TENANT'S INSURANCE. Tenant shall maintain the following coverages
in the following amounts.

               10.3.1 Commercial General Liability Insurance covering the
insured against claims of bodily injury, personal injury and property damage
(including loss of use thereof) arising out of Tenant's operations, and
contractual liabilities (covering the performance by Tenant of its indemnity
agreements) including a Broad Form endorsement covering the insuring provisions
of this Lease and the performance by Tenant of the indemnity agreements set
forth in Section 10.1 of this Lease, for limits of liability not less than:

Bodily Injury and Property           $3,000,000 each occurrence
Damage Liability                     $3,000,000 annual aggregate

Personal Injury Liability            $3,000,000 each occurrence
                                     $3,000,000 annual aggregate


                                      -24-
<PAGE>   28

                                     0% Insured's participation

               10.3.2 Physical Damage Insurance covering (i) all office
furniture, business and trade fixtures, office equipment, free-standing cabinet
work, movable partitions, merchandise and all other items of Tenant's property
on the Premises installed by, for, or at the expense of Tenant, (ii) the "Tenant
Improvements," as that term is defined in the Tenant Work Letter, and any other
improvements which exist in the Premises as of the Lease Commencement Date
(excluding the Base Building) (the "ORIGINAL IMPROVEMENTS"), and (iii) all other
improvements, alterations and additions to the Premises. Such insurance shall be
written on an "all risks" of physical loss or damage basis, for the full
replacement cost value (subject to reasonable deductible amounts) new without
deduction for depreciation of the covered items and in amounts that meet any
co-insurance clauses of the policies of insurance and shall include coverage for
damage or other loss caused by fire or other peril including, but not limited
to, vandalism and malicious mischief, theft, water damage of any type, including
sprinkler leakage, bursting or stoppage of pipes, and explosion, and providing
business interruption and loss-of-earnings coverage for a period of one year.

               10.3.3 Worker's Compensation and Employer's Liability or other
similar insurance pursuant to all applicable state and local statutes and
regulations.

        10.4 FORM OF POLICIES. The minimum limits of policies of insurance
required of Tenant under this Lease shall in no event limit the liability of
Tenant under this Lease. Such insurance shall (i) name Landlord, and any other
party the Landlord so specifies, as an additional insured, including Landlord's
managing agent, if any; (ii) specifically cover the liability assumed by Tenant
under this Lease, including, but not limited to, Tenant's obligations under
Section 10.1 of this Lease; (iii) be issued by an insurance company having a
rating of not less than A-X in Best's Insurance Guide or which is otherwise
acceptable to Landlord and licensed to do business in the State of Arizona; (iv)
be primary insurance as to all claims thereunder and provide that any insurance
carried by Landlord is excess and is non-contributing with any insurance
requirement of Tenant; (v) be in form and content reasonably acceptable to
Landlord; and (vi) provide that said insurance shall not be canceled or coverage
changed unless thirty (30) days' prior written notice shall have been given to
Landlord and any mortgagee of Landlord. Tenant shall deliver said policy or
policies or certificates thereof to Landlord on or before the Lease Commencement
Date and shall deliver a renewal policy or renewal certificate thereof to
Landlord at least thirty (30) days before the expiration dates thereof. In the
event Tenant shall fail to procure such insurance, or to deliver such policies
or certificate, Landlord may, at its option, procure such policies for the
account of Tenant, and the cost thereof shall be paid to Landlord within five
(5) days after delivery to Tenant of bills therefor.

        10.5 SUBROGATION. Landlord and Tenant intend that their respective
property loss risks shall be borne by reasonable insurance carriers to the
extent above provided, and Landlord and Tenant hereby agree to look solely to,
and seek recovery only from, their respective insurance carriers in the event of
a property loss to the extent that such coverage is agreed to be provided
hereunder. The parties each hereby waive all rights and claims against each
other for such losses, and waive all rights of subrogation of their respective
insurers, provided such waiver of subrogation shall not affect the right to the
insured to recover thereunder. The parties agree that their respective insurance
policies are now, or shall be, endorsed such that the waiver of


                                      -25-
<PAGE>   29

subrogation shall not affect the right of the insured to recover thereunder, so
long as no material additional premium is charged therefor.

        10.6 ADDITIONAL INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS. Tenant shall carry and maintain
during the entire Lease Term, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, increased
amounts of the insurance required to be carried by Tenant pursuant to this
Article 10 and such other reasonable types of insurance coverage and in such
reasonable amounts covering the Premises and Tenant's operations therein, as may
be reasonably requested by Landlord.

        10.7 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF LANDLORD'S INSURANCE. Landlord shall
maintain insurance through individual or blanket policies insuring the Building
against fire and extended coverage (including, if Landlord elects, "all risk"
coverage, earthquake/volcanic action, flood and/or surface water insurance) for
the full replacement cost of the Building, with deductibles and the form and
endorsements of such coverage as reasonably selected by Landlord, together with
rental abatement insurance against loss of Rent in an amount equal to the amount
of Rent for a period of at least twelve (12) months commencing on the date of
loss. Landlord may also carry such other insurance as Landlord may reasonably
deem prudent or advisable, including, without limitation, liability insurance in
such amounts and on such terms as Landlord shall reasonably determine; provided,
however, that such insurance shall be in a form, amount and type of coverage as
carried by other prudent landlords of Comparable Buildings. Tenant shall pay to
Landlord, as a portion of the Operating Expenses, the costs of the insurance
coverages described herein, including, without limitation, Landlord's cost of
any self-insurance deductible or retention.

                                   ARTICLE 11

                             DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION

        11.1 REPAIR OF DAMAGE TO PREMISES BY LANDLORD. Tenant shall promptly
notify Landlord of any damage to the Premises resulting from fire or any other
casualty. If the Premises or any Common Areas serving or providing access to the
Premises shall be damaged by fire or other casualty, Landlord shall promptly and
diligently, subject to reasonable delays for insurance adjustment or other
matters beyond Landlord's reasonable control, and subject to all other terms of
this Article 11, restore the Base Building, the Premises (including Tenant Work)
and such Common Areas. Such restoration shall be to substantially the same
condition of the Base Building, the Premises (including Tenant Work) and the
Common Areas prior to the casualty, except for modifications required by zoning
and building codes and other laws or by the holder of a mortgage on the Building
or Project. Upon the occurrence of any damage to the Premises, upon notice (the
"LANDLORD REPAIR NOTICE") to Tenant from Landlord, Tenant shall assign to
Landlord (or to any party designated by Landlord) all insurance proceeds payable
to Tenant under Tenant's insurance required under Section 10.3 of this Lease,
and Landlord shall repair any injury or damage to the Tenant Improvements and
the Original Improvements installed in the Premises and shall return such Tenant
Improvements and Original Improvements to their original condition. Landlord
shall not be liable for any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or its
visitors, or injury to Tenant's business resulting in any way from such damage
or the repair thereof; provided however, that if such fire or other casualty
shall have damaged the Premises or Common Areas necessary to Tenant's occupancy,
and the Premises are not occupied


                                      -26-
<PAGE>   30

by Tenant as a result thereof, then during the time and to the extent the
Premises are unfit for occupancy, the Rent shall be abated in proportion to the
ratio that the amount of rentable square feet of the Premises which is unfit for
occupancy for the purposes permitted under this Lease bears to the total
rentable square feet of the Premises.

        11.2 LANDLORD'S OPTION TO REPAIR. Notwithstanding the terms of Section
11.1 of this Lease, Landlord may elect not to rebuild and/or restore the
Premises, Building and/or Project, and instead terminate this Lease, by
notifying Tenant in writing of such termination within sixty (60) days after the
date of discovery of the damage, such notice to include a termination date
giving Tenant sixty (60) days to vacate the Premises, but Landlord may so elect
only if the Building or Project shall be damaged by fire or other casualty or
cause, whether or not the Premises are affected, and one or more of the
following conditions is present: (i) in Landlord's reasonable judgment, repairs
cannot reasonably be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the
date of discovery of the damage (when such repairs are made without the payment
of overtime or other premiums); (ii) the holder of any mortgage on the Building
or Project or ground lessor with respect to the Building or Project shall
require that the insurance proceeds or any portion thereof be used to retire the
mortgage debt, or shall terminate the ground lease, as the case may be; or (iii)
the damage occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the Lease Term. In
addition to Landlord's rights to terminate as set forth above, Tenant shall have
the right to terminate this Lease under this Section 11.2 upon delivery of
thirty (30) days' written notice to Landlord and only if each of the following
conditions is satisfied: (a) the damage to the Project by fire or other casualty
was not caused by the gross negligence or intentional act of Tenant or its
partners or subpartners and their respective officers, agents, servants,
employees, and independent contractors; (b) Tenant is not then in default under
this Lease; (c) as a result of the damage, Tenant cannot reasonably conduct
business from the Premises; and, (d) as a result of the damage to the Project,
Tenant does not occupy or use the Premises at all.

        11.3 WAIVER OF STATUTORY PROVISIONS. The provisions of this Lease,
including this Article 11, constitute an express agreement between Landlord and
Tenant with respect to any and all damage to, or destruction of, all or any part
of the Premises, the Building or the Project, and any statute or regulation of
the State of Arizona, including without limitation, Arizona Revised Statutes
Section 33-343, with respect to any rights or obligations concerning damage or
destruction in the absence of an express agreement between the parties, and any
other statute or regulation, now or hereafter in effect, shall have no
application to this Lease or any damage or destruction to all or any part of the
Premises, the Building or the Project.

                                   ARTICLE 12

                                    NONWAIVER

        No provision of this Lease shall be deemed waived by either party hereto
unless expressly waived in a writing signed thereby. The waiver by either party
hereto of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein contained shall
not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of same or any other term,
covenant or condition herein contained. The subsequent acceptance of Rent
hereunder by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach
by Tenant of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease, other than the
failure of Tenant to pay the particular Rent so accepted, regardless of
Landlord's knowledge of


                                      -27-
<PAGE>   31

such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent. No acceptance of a
lesser amount than the Rent herein stipulated shall be deemed a waiver of
Landlord's right to receive the full amount due, nor shall any endorsement or
statement on any check or payment or any letter accompanying such check or
payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check
or payment without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the full amount due.
No receipt of monies by Landlord from Tenant after the termination of this Lease
shall in any way alter the length of the Lease Term or of Tenant's right of
possession hereunder, or after the giving of any notice shall reinstate,
continue or extend the Lease Term or affect any notice given Tenant prior to the
receipt of such monies, it being agreed that after the service of notice or the
commencement of a suit, or after final judgment for possession of the Premises,
Landlord may receive and collect any Rent due, and the payment of said Rent
shall not waive or affect said notice, suit or judgment.

                                   ARTICLE 13

                                  CONDEMNATION

        If the whole or any part of the Premises, Building or Project shall be
taken by power of eminent domain or condemned by any competent authority for any
public or quasi-public use or purpose, or if any adjacent property or street
shall be so taken or condemned, or reconfigured or vacated by such authority in
such manner as to require the use, reconstruction or remodeling of any part of
the Premises, Building or Project, or if Landlord shall grant a deed or other
instrument in lieu of such taking by eminent domain or condemnation, Landlord
shall have the option to terminate this Lease effective as of the date
possession is required to be surrendered to the authority. If such portion of
the rentable square feet of the Premises is taken such that, in Tenant's
reasonable business judgment, the Premises are no longer suitable for the
conduct of Tenant's business therein, and if the notice of such taking shall be
in effect for at least one hundred eighty (180) days, Tenant shall have the
option to terminate this Lease effective as of the date possession is required
to be surrendered to the authority. Tenant shall not because of such taking
assert any claim against Landlord or the authority for any compensation because
of such taking and Landlord shall be entitled to the entire award or payment in
connection therewith, except that Tenant shall have the right to file any
separate claim available to Tenant for any taking of Tenant's personal property
and fixtures belonging to Tenant and removable by Tenant upon expiration of the
Lease Term pursuant to the terms of this Lease, and for moving expenses, so long
as such claims do not diminish the award available to Landlord, its ground
lessor with respect to the Building or Project or its mortgagee, and such claim
is payable separately to Tenant. All Rent shall be apportioned as of the date of
such termination. If any part of the Premises shall be taken, and this Lease
shall not be so terminated, the Rent shall be proportionately abated.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 13, in the
event of a temporary taking of all or any portion of the Premises for a period
of one hundred and eighty (180) days or less, then this Lease shall not
terminate but the Base Rent and the Additional Rent shall be abated for the
period of such taking in proportion to the ratio that the amount of rentable
square feet of the Premises taken bears to the total rentable square feet of the
Premises. Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award made in
connection with any such temporary taking.

                                   ARTICLE 14

                            ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING

        14.1 TRANSFERS. Tenant shall not, without the prior written consent of
Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, assign, mortgage,
pledge, hypothecate, encumber, or otherwise transfer, this Lease or any interest
hereunder, permit any assignment, or other transfer of this Lease or any
interest hereunder by operation of law, sublet the Premises or any part thereof
or otherwise permit the occupancy or use of the Premises or any part thereof by
any persons other than Tenant and its employees and contractors (all of the
foregoing are hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as "TRANSFERS" and
any person to whom any Transfer is made or sought to be made is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as a "TRANSFEREE"). If Tenant desires Landlord's consent
to any Transfer, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing, which notice (the
"TRANSFER NOTICE") shall include (i) the proposed effective date of the
Transfer, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than one
hundred eighty (180) days after the date of delivery of the Transfer Notice,
(ii) a description of the portion of the Premises to be transferred (the
"SUBJECT SPACE"), (iii) all of the terms of the proposed Transfer and the
consideration therefor, including calculation of the "Transfer Premium", as that
term is defined in Section 14.3 below, in connection with such Transfer, the
name and address of the proposed Transferee, and a copy of all existing executed
and/or proposed documentation pertaining to the proposed Transfer, including all
existing operative documents to be executed to evidence such Transfer or the
agreements incidental or related to such Transfer, (iv) current financial
statements of the proposed Transferee certified by an officer, partner or owner
thereof, business credit and personal references and history of the proposed
Transferee and any other information reasonably required by Landlord which will
enable Landlord to determine the financial responsibility, character, and
reputation of the proposed Transferee, nature of such Transferee's business and
proposed use of the Subject Space, and (v) an executed estoppel certificate from
Tenant in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT E. Landlord shall respond to
Tenant within ten (10) business days. Any Transfer made without Landlord's prior
written consent shall, at Landlord's option, be null, void and of no effect, and
shall, at Landlord's option, constitute a default by Tenant under this Lease.
Whether or not Landlord consents to any proposed Transfer, Tenant shall pay
Landlord's reasonable review and processing fees, as well as any reasonable
actual third-party professional fees (including, without limitation, attorneys',
accountants', architects', engineers' and consultants' fees) incurred by
Landlord (which fees, in the case of a Transfer which does not require any
modification of this Lease to accommodate specific requirements of the proposed
Transferee, shall not exceed $1,500), within thirty (30) days after written
request by Landlord.

        14.2 LANDLORD'S CONSENT. Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or
delay its consent to any proposed Transfer of the Subject Space to the
Transferee on the terms specified in the Transfer Notice. Without limitation as
to other reasonable grounds for withholding consent, the parties hereby agree
that it shall be reasonable under this Lease and under any applicable law for
Landlord to withhold consent to any proposed Transfer where one or more of the
following apply:

               14.2.1 The Transferee intends to use the Subject Space for
purposes which are not permitted under this Lease;


                                      -29-
<PAGE>   33

               14.2.2 The Transferee is either a governmental agency or
instrumentality thereof, and Landlord has not previously approved the occupancy
of any portion of the Project by a governmental entity or instrumentality
thereof;

               14.2.3 The Transferee is not a party of reasonable financial
worth and/or financial stability in light of the responsibilities to be
undertaken in connection with the Transfer on the date consent is requested;

               14.2.4 The proposed Transfer would cause a violation of another
lease for space in the Project, or would give an occupant of the Project a right
to cancel its lease; or

               14.2.5 Either the proposed Transferee, or any person or entity
which directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with, the proposed Transferee, (i) occupies space in the Project at the
time of the request for consent, or (ii) is negotiating with Landlord or has
negotiated with Landlord during the six (6) month period immediately preceding
the date Landlord receives the Transfer Notice, to lease space in the Project.

        If Landlord consents to any Transfer pursuant to the terms of this
Section 14.2 (and does not exercise any recapture rights Landlord may have under
Section 14.4 of this Lease), Tenant may within six (6) months after Landlord's
consent, but not later than the expiration of said six-month period, enter into
such Transfer of the Premises or portion thereof, upon substantially the same
terms and conditions as are set forth in the Transfer Notice furnished by Tenant
to Landlord pursuant to Section 14.1 of this Lease, provided that if there are
any changes in the terms and conditions from those specified in the Transfer
Notice (i) such that Landlord would initially have been entitled to refuse its
consent to such Transfer under this Section 14.2, or (ii) which would cause the
proposed Transfer to be more favorable to the Transferee than the terms set
forth in Tenant's original Transfer Notice, Tenant shall again submit the
Transfer to Landlord for its approval and other action under this Article 14
(including Landlord's right of recapture, if any, under Section 14.4 of this
Lease).

        14.3 TRANSFER PREMIUM. If Landlord consents to a Transfer, as a
condition thereto which the parties hereby agree is reasonable, Tenant shall pay
to Landlord [*] of any "Transfer Premium," as that term is defined in this
Section 14.3, received by Tenant from such Transferee. "TRANSFER PREMIUM" shall
mean all rent, additional rent or other consideration actually received by
Tenant in connection with the Transfer in excess of the Rent and Additional Rent
payable by Tenant under this Lease during the term of the Transfer on a per
rentable square foot basis if less than all of the Premises is transferred,
after deducting the reasonable expenses incurred by Tenant for (i) any changes,
alterations and improvements to the Premises in connection with the Transfer,
(ii) any free base rent reasonably provided to the Transferee in connection with
the Transfer, (iii) any brokerage commissions in connection with the Transfer,
(iv) legal fees, (v) moving costs, (vi) advertising costs; (vii) lease
takeover/assumption costs, (viii) key money, bonus money or other cash
consideration paid by Transferee to Tenant in connection with such Transfer,
(ix) any payment in excess of fair market value for services rendered by Tenant
to Transferee or for assets, fixtures, inventory, equipment, or furniture
transferred by Tenant to Transferee in connection with such Transfer, and (x)
any other costs necessary to induce the Transferee to enter into the Transfer
with Tenant (collectively, "TENANT'S SUBLEASING COSTS").

        14.4 [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]

        14.5 EFFECT OF TRANSFER. If Landlord consents to a Transfer, (i) the
terms and conditions of this Lease shall in no way be deemed to have been waived
or modified, (ii) such consent shall not be deemed consent to any further
Transfer by either Tenant or a Transferee, (iii) Tenant shall deliver to
Landlord, promptly after execution, an original executed copy of all
documentation pertaining to the Transfer in form reasonably acceptable to
Landlord, (iv) Tenant shall furnish upon Landlord's request a complete
statement, certified by an independent certified public accountant, or Tenant's
chief financial officer, setting forth in detail the computation of any Transfer
Premium Tenant has derived and shall derive from such Transfer, and (v) no
Transfer relating to this Lease or agreement entered into with respect thereto,
whether with or without Landlord's consent, shall relieve Tenant or any
guarantor of the Lease from any liability under this Lease, including, without
limitation, in connection with the Subject Space. Landlord or its authorized
representatives shall have the right at all reasonable times to audit the books,
records and papers of Tenant relating to any Transfer, and shall have the right
to make copies thereof. If the Transfer Premium respecting any Transfer shall be
found understated, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after demand, pay the
deficiency, and if understated by more than two percent (2%), Tenant shall pay
Landlord's costs of such audit.

        14.6 NON-TRANSFERS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Article 14 of this Lease, an assignment or subletting by Tenant of all or a
portion of the Premises or this Lease to (i) a parent or subsidiary of Tenant,
or (ii) any person or entity which controls, is controlled by or under common
control with Tenant, or (iii) any entity which purchases all or substantially
all of the stock or assets of Tenant, or (iv) any entity into which Tenant is
merged or consolidated (all such persons or entities described in (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) being sometimes hereinafter referred to as "Affiliates"), shall
not require Landlord's consent and shall not be deemed a Transfer under Article
14 of this Lease, provided that (a) any such Affiliate was not formed as a
subterfuge to avoid the obligations of Article 14 of this Lease; (b) Tenant
gives Landlord at least ten (10) days' prior notice of any such assignment or
sublease to an Affiliate or as soon as reasonably possible as may be provided by
any applicable laws or regulations; (c) such Affiliate shall have, as of the
effective date of any such assignment or sublease, a tangible net worth,
computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (but
excluding goodwill as an asset), which is sufficient to meet the obligations of
Tenant under this Lease and is equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant
as of the date of the Transfer; (d) any such assignment or sublease shall be
subject and subordinate to all of the terms and provisions of this Lease, and
such Affiliate shall assume, in a written document reasonably satisfactory to
Landlord and delivered to Landlord upon or prior to the effective date of such
assignment or sublease, all the obligations of Tenant under this Lease with
respect to the portion of the Premises which is the subject of such assignment
or sublease (other than the amount of Base Rent payable by Tenant with respect
to a sublease); and (e) Tenant and any guarantor shall remain fully liable for
all obligations to be performed by Tenant under this Lease. Landlord hereby
acknowledges that Tenant has advised Landlord that Tenant will become affiliated
with NextBank, and, upon receipt of notice by Landlord of its formation, agrees
that NextBank shall be an Affiliate for purposes of this Section 14.6. In
addition, a sale or transfer of the capital stock of Tenant shall be permitted
without Landlord's consent, provided, that (A) such sale or transfer occurs in
connection with any bona fide financing or capitalization for the benefit of
Tenant or (B) Tenant initially becomes a publicly traded corporation; provided,
however, that


                                      -31-
<PAGE>   35

(i) any such sale or transfer was not done as a subterfuge to avoid the
obligations of Articles 14 of this Lease; (ii) Tenant gives Landlord at least
ten (10) days prior notice of any such sale or transfer, described in (A) or (B)
above, or as soon as reasonably possible as may be provided by any applicable
laws or regulations; and (iii) if the resulting entity, as of the effective date
of any such sale or transfer does not have a tangible net worth, computed in
accordance with GAAP (but excluding goodwill as an asset) which is sufficient to
meet the obligations of Tenant under this Lease and is not equal to or greater
than the net worth of Tenant as of the date of the Transfer, then Landlord shall
have the right to request an additional amount to add to the Security Deposit
from such resulting entity in order to assure the performance of Tenant's
obligations under this Lease.

        14.7 OCCURRENCE OF DEFAULT. Any Transfer hereunder shall be subordinate
and subject to the provisions of this Lease, and if this Lease shall be
terminated during the term of any Transfer, Landlord shall have the right to:
(i) treat such Transfer as canceled and repossess the Subject Space by any
lawful means, or (ii) require that such Transferee attorn to and recognize
Landlord as its landlord under any such Transfer. If Tenant shall be in default
under this Lease, Landlord is hereby irrevocably authorized, as Tenant's agent
and attorney-in-fact, to direct any Transferee to make all payments under or in
connection with the Transfer directly to Landlord (which Landlord shall apply
towards Tenant's obligations under this Lease) until such default is cured. Such
Transferee shall rely on any representation by Landlord that Tenant is in
default hereunder, without any need for confirmation thereof by Tenant. Upon any
assignment, the assignee shall assume in writing all obligations and covenants
of Tenant thereafter to be performed or observed under this Lease. No collection
or acceptance of rent by Landlord from any Transferee shall be deemed a waiver
of any provision of this Article 14 or the approval of any Transferee or a
release of Tenant from any obligation under this Lease, whether theretofore or
thereafter accruing. In no event shall Landlord's enforcement of any provision
of this Lease against any Transferee be deemed a waiver of Landlord's right to
enforce any term of this Lease against Tenant or any other person. If Tenant's
obligations hereunder have been guaranteed, Landlord's consent to any Transfer
shall not be effective unless the guarantor also consents to such Transfer.

        14.8 RELEASE OF TENANT. If Landlord approves a Transfer which is an
assignment by Tenant to: (i) in the case of a publicly held company, an entity
with a market share equal to or greater than the "Market Cap" of Tenant (i.e.,
common outstanding shares multiplied by the price per share) as of the date of
execution of this Lease, or, if higher, the Market Cap of Tenant as of the date
of the request for approval of such Transfer (but in no event higher than
[ * ]); or, (ii) in the case of a non-publicly held company, to an entity with
a net worth, as reflected in such entity's most recent audited financial
statements, of [*], Landlord shall, upon the full execution and
delivery of Landlord's consent to such assignment, enter into a release
agreement whereby Tenant shall be relieved of all further liability or
obligation under this Lease.

                        SURRENDER OF PREMISES; OWNERSHIP
                          AND REMOVAL OF TRADE FIXTURES

        15.1 SURRENDER OF PREMISES. No act or thing done by either party or its
agent or employee during the Lease Term shall be deemed to constitute an
acceptance by Landlord of a surrender of the Premises unless such intent is
specifically acknowledged in writing by both parties. The delivery of keys to
the Premises to Landlord or any agent or employee of Landlord shall not
constitute a surrender of the Premises or effect a termination of this Lease,
whether or not the keys are thereafter retained by Landlord, and notwithstanding
such delivery Tenant shall be entitled to the return of such keys at any
reasonable time upon request until this Lease shall have been properly
terminated. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant, whether
accepted by Landlord or not, or a mutual termination hereof, shall not work a
merger, and at the option of Landlord shall operate as an assignment to Landlord
of all subleases or subtenancies affecting the Premises or terminate any or all
such sublessees or subtenancies.

        15.2 REMOVAL OF TENANT PROPERTY BY TENANT. Within three (3) days
following the expiration of the Lease Term, or upon any earlier termination of
this Lease, Tenant shall, subject to the provisions of this Article 15, quit and
surrender possession of the Premises to Landlord in as good order and condition
as when Tenant took possession and as thereafter improved by Landlord and/or
Tenant, reasonable wear and tear and repairs which are specifically made the
responsibility of Landlord hereunder excepted. Within such three (3) day period,
Tenant shall, without expense to Landlord, remove or cause to be removed from
the Premises all debris and rubbish, and such items of furniture, equipment,
business and trade fixtures, free-standing cabinet work, movable partitions and
other articles of personal property owned by Tenant or installed or placed by
Tenant at its expense in the Premises, and such similar articles of any other
persons claiming under Tenant, as Landlord may, in its sole discretion, require
to be removed, and Tenant shall repair at its own expense all damage to the
Premises and Building resulting from such removal. Within said three (3) day
period Tenant shall not be obligated to pay Rent.

                                  HOLDING OVER

        If Tenant holds over after the expiration of the Lease Term or earlier
termination thereof, with or without the express or implied consent of Landlord,
such tenancy shall be from month-to-month only, and shall not constitute a
renewal hereof or an extension for any further term, and in such case Rent shall
be payable at a monthly rate equal to the product of (i) the Rent applicable
during the last rental period of the Lease Term under this Lease, and (ii) a
percentage equal to (A) [*] for the first and second months of such holdover;
(B) [*] for the third month of such holdover; and (C) [*] for the fourth month
and any additional months of such holdover as liquidated damages. Such
month-to-month tenancy shall be subject to every other applicable term, covenant
and agreement contained herein. Nothing contained in this Article 16 shall be
construed as consent by Landlord to any holding over by Tenant, and Landlord
expressly reserves the right to require Tenant to surrender possession of the
Premises to Landlord as

provided in this Lease upon the expiration or other termination of this Lease.
The provisions of this Article 16 shall not be deemed to limit or constitute a
waiver of any other rights or remedies of Landlord provided herein or at law. If
Tenant fails to surrender the Premises upon the termination or expiration of
this Lease, in addition to any other liabilities to Landlord accruing therefrom,
Tenant shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from all
loss, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and liability resulting from
such failure, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any
claims made by any succeeding tenant founded upon such failure to surrender and
any lost profits to Landlord resulting therefrom.

                              ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES

        Within ten (10) days following a request in writing by Landlord, which
request shall be given no more frequently than once in any consecutive twelve
(12) month period and which may only be given in the context of a proposed
financing to be secured by a lien on the Project or a proposed sale of the
Project, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord an estoppel
certificate, which, as submitted by Landlord, shall be substantially in the form
of EXHIBIT E, attached hereto (or such other form as may be required by any
prospective mortgagee or purchaser of the Project, or any portion thereof),
indicating therein any exceptions thereto that may exist at that time, and shall
also contain any other information reasonably requested by Landlord or
Landlord's mortgagee or prospective mortgagee. Any such certificate may be
relied upon by any prospective mortgagee or purchaser of all or any portion of
the Project. Tenant shall execute and deliver whatever other instruments may be
reasonably required for such purposes. Within ten (10) days following a request
in writing by Tenant, Landlord shall execute and deliver to Tenant an estoppel
certificate similar in form and substance to EXHIBIT E, taking into account the
context of the fact that the Landlord is executing such certificate. At any time
during the Lease Term, Landlord may require Tenant to provide Landlord with a
current financial statement and financial statements of the two (2) years prior
to the current financial statement year, audited if such statements had been
prepared by a third-party auditor or, if internally prepared, certified by an
officer of Tenant. Failure of Tenant to timely execute, acknowledge and deliver
such estoppel certificate or other instruments shall constitute an acceptance of
the Premises and an acknowledgment by Tenant that statements included in the
estoppel certificate are true and correct, without exception.

                                   ARTICLE 18

                                  SUBORDINATION

        This Lease shall be subject and subordinate to all present and future
ground or underlying leases of the Building or Project and to the lien of any
mortgage, trust deed or other encumbrances now or hereafter in force against the
Building or Project or any part thereof, if any, and to all renewals,
extensions, modifications, consolidations and replacements thereof, and to all
advances made or hereafter to be made upon the security of such mortgages or
trust deeds, unless the holders of such mortgages, trust deeds or other
encumbrances, or the lessors under such ground lease or underlying leases,
require in writing that this Lease be superior thereto. Landlord shall provide a
commercially reasonable subordination, attornment and nondisturbance


                                      -34-
<PAGE>   38

agreement ("SNDA") from Guaranty Federal Bank which currently holds a first
mortgage lien encumbering the Project. The standard form of SNDA issued by
Guaranty Federal Bank, attached as EXHIBIT F, has been delivered to Tenant and
any modifications thereto which shall be necessary to cause such SNDA to be
"commercially reasonable" shall be negotiated by Landlord, Tenant and Guaranty
Federal Bank in a diligent manner so as to complete, execute and record the SNDA
not later than sixty (60) days following the date of this Lease. Further,
Landlord shall use its best good faith, diligent and commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Tenant with a nondisturbance agreement in a commercially
reasonable and recordable form from any future lender holding a deed of trust on
the Project. Tenant covenants and agrees in the event any proceedings are
brought for the foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed in lieu thereof (or if
any ground lease is terminated), to attorn, without any deductions or set-offs
whatsoever except as expressly provided in this Lease or in any SNDA, to the
lienholder or purchaser or any successors thereto upon any such foreclosure sale
or deed in lieu thereof (or to the ground lessor), if so requested to do so by
such purchaser or lienholder or ground lessor, and to recognize such purchaser
or lienholder or ground lessor as the lessor under this Lease, provided such
lienholder or purchaser or ground lessor shall agree to accept this Lease and
not disturb Tenant's occupancy, so long as Tenant timely pays the rent and
observes and performs the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to be
observed and performed by Tenant. Landlord's interest herein may be assigned as
security at any time to any lienholder. Tenant shall, within ten (10) days of
request by Landlord, execute such further instruments or assurances as Landlord
may reasonably deem necessary to evidence or confirm the subordination or
superiority of this Lease to any such mortgages, trust deeds, ground leases or
underlying leases.

                                   ARTICLE 19

                               DEFAULTS; REMEDIES

        19.1 EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute a default of this Lease by Tenant:

               19.1.1 Any failure by Tenant to pay any Rent or any other charge
required to be paid under this Lease, or any part thereof, when due unless such
failure is cured within five (5) business days after Tenant's receipt of notice;
or

               19.1.2 Except where a specific time period is otherwise set forth
for Tenant's performance in this Lease, in which event the failure to perform by
Tenant within such time period shall be a default by Tenant under this Section
19.1.2, any failure by Tenant to observe or perform any other provision,
covenant or condition of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant where
such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from
Landlord to Tenant; provided that if the nature of such default is such that the
same cannot reasonably be cured within a thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall
not be deemed to be in default if it diligently commences such cure within such
period and thereafter diligently proceeds to rectify and cure such default; or

               19.1.3 Abandonment of the Premises for a period of fifteen (15)
days following delivery of notice to Tenant that Tenant has failed to pay a
scheduled Base Rent or Additional Rent payment hereunder, or vacation of all or
a substantial portion of the Premises by Tenant


                                      -35-
<PAGE>   39

unless adequate security procedures have been approved by Landlord and
maintained in force by Tenant at Tenant's sole cost and expense in order to
avoid vandalism at the Premises and in order to minimize increases in insurance
premiums for the Building; or

               19.1.4 To the extent permitted by law, a general assignment by
Tenant or any guarantor of the Lease for the benefit of creditors, or the taking
of any corporate action in furtherance of bankruptcy or dissolution whether or
not there exists any proceeding under an insolvency or bankruptcy law, or the
filing by or against Tenant or any guarantor of any proceeding under an
insolvency or bankruptcy law, unless in the case of a proceeding filed against
Tenant or any guarantor the same is dismissed within sixty (60) days, or the
appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of all or substantially
all of the assets of Tenant or any guarantor, unless possession is restored to
Tenant or such guarantor within thirty (30) days, or any execution or other
judicially authorized seizure of all or substantially all of Tenant's assets
located upon the Premises or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, unless such
seizure is discharged within thirty (30) days.

        The notice periods provided herein are in lieu of, and not in addition
to, any notice periods provided by law.

        19.2 REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of any event of default
by Tenant, Landlord shall have, in addition to any other remedies available to
Landlord at law or in equity (all of which remedies shall be distinct, separate
and cumulative), the option to pursue any one or more of the following remedies,
each and all of which shall be cumulative and nonexclusive, without any notice
or demand whatsoever.

               19.2.1 Terminate this Lease, in which event Tenant shall
immediately surrender the Premises to Landlord, and if Tenant fails to do so,
Landlord may, without prejudice to any other remedy which it may have for
possession or arrearages in rent, enter upon and take possession of the Premises
and expel or remove Tenant and any other person who may be occupying the
Premises or any part thereof, without being liable for prosecution or any claim
or damages therefor; and Landlord may recover from Tenant the following:

               (i) The worth at the time of any unpaid rent which has been
        earned at the time of such termination; plus

               (ii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the
        unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the
        time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves
        could have been reasonably avoided; plus

               (iii) The worth at the time of award of the amount by which the
        unpaid rent for the balance of the Lease Term after the time of award
        exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have
        been reasonably avoided; plus

               (iv) Any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all
        the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to perform its
        obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things
        would be likely to result therefrom, specifically including but not
        limited to, brokerage commissions and advertising expenses incurred,


                                      -36-
<PAGE>   40

        and expenses of remodeling the Premises or any portion thereof for a new
        tenant, whether for the same or a different use; and

               (v) At Landlord's election, such other amounts in addition to or
        in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by
        applicable law.

        The term "rent" as used in this Section 19.2 shall be deemed to have the
meaning assigned such term in the Lease. As used in Sections 19.2.1(i) and (ii),
above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest
at the rate set forth in Article 25 of this Lease, but in no case greater than
the maximum amount of such interest permitted by law. As used in Section
19.2.1(iii) above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by
discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%).

               19.2.2 Landlord shall at all times have all the rights and
remedies available at law or in equity (which shall be cumulative with each
other and cumulative and in addition to those rights and remedies available
under Section 19.2.1 above or other provision of this Lease), without prior
demand or notice except as required by applicable law, to seek any declaratory,
injunctive or other equitable relief, and specifically enforce this Lease, or
restrain or enjoin a violation or breach of any provision hereof, and including,
without limitation, the following:

               (i) Landlord may re-enter and take possession of all or any part
        of the Premises and remove Tenant and any person claiming under Tenant
        from the Premises, using reasonable force, if necessary, and without
        committing a trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage that may
        be occasioned thereby. Landlord may also change the locks to the
        Premises without notice at Tenant's expense. Re-entry and repossession
        of the Premises will not by themselves terminate the Lease.

               (ii) Landlord may remove any property, including fixtures, from
        the Premises and store the same at Tenant's expense in a warehouse or
        any other location, or Landlord may lease the property on the Premises
        pending sale or other disposition. If Landlord leaves the property on
        the Premises or stores it at another location owned or controlled by
        Landlord, then Landlord may charge Tenant a reasonable fee for storing
        and handling the property comparable to what Landlord would have had to
        pay to a third party for such services. Landlord will not be liable
        under any circumstances to Tenant or to anyone else for any damage to
        the property. Landlord shall proceed to sell Tenant's property in
        accordance with Arizona law.

               (iii) Landlord may collect any rents or other payments that
        become due from any subtenant, concessionaire or licensee, and may in
        his own name or in Tenant's name bring suit for such amounts, and settle
        any claims therefor, without approving the terms of the sublease or of
        Tenant's agreement with the concessionaire or licensee and without
        prejudice to Landlord's right to terminate the sublease or agreement
        without cause and remove the subtenant, concessionaire or licensee from
        the Premises.

               (iv) Landlord may appoint, or have appointed through appropriate
        court proceedings, a receiver to take possession of the Premises and
        operate Tenant's business


                                      -37-
<PAGE>   41

        in accordance with the terms of the Lease, with full power to exercise
        all rights and privileges Tenant has under the Lease, including the
        power to collect the income and pay the expenses of the business, or
        with such limited powers as Landlord or the court appointing the
        receiver may deem advisable. The receiver will not be required to post
        any bond, and will be entitled to obtain insurance to protect himself
        against liability from his errors and omissions or otherwise arising in
        the course of performing of his duties. The fees and expenses of the
        receiver, including the cost of any errors and omissions or liability
        insurance, will be charged to Tenant.

               (v) Landlord may relet the Premises at whatever rent and on
        whatever terms and conditions are commercially reasonable. The term of
        any new lease may be shorter or longer than the remaining term of this
        Lease. In reletting the Premises, Landlord may make any alterations or
        repairs to the Premises he feels are necessary or desirable; may
        subdivide the Premises into more than one unit and lease each portion
        separately; may sell Tenant's improvements, fixtures and other property
        located on the Premises to the new tenant, or include such improvements,
        fixtures and property as part of the Premises without additional cost;
        may advertise the Premises for sale or lease; may hire brokers or other
        agents; and, may do anything else he deems necessary or helpful in
        reletting the Premises. Tenant will be liable to Landlord for all costs
        and expenses of the reletting including but not limited to rental
        concessions to the new tenant, broker's commissions and tenant
        improvements, and will remain liable for the rent and all other charges
        arising under the Lease, less any income received from the new tenant,
        unless the Lease is terminated as set forth below.

               (vi) Landlord may sue Tenant for possession of the Premises, for
        damages for breach of the Lease, and for any other appropriate relief,
        either in the same or in separate actions. Landlord may recover all
        costs and expenses he incurs in any such suit, including reasonable
        attorneys' fees.

               19.2.3 Landlord shall at all times have the rights and remedies
(which shall be cumulative with each other and cumulative and in addition to
those rights and remedies available under Sections 19.2.1 and 19.2.2, above, or
any law or other provision of this Lease), without prior demand or notice except
as required by applicable law, to seek any declaratory, injunctive or other
equitable relief, and specifically enforce this Lease, or restrain or enjoin a
violation or breach of any provision hereof.

        19.3 SUBLEASES OF TENANT. Subject to the provisions of Section 14,
whether or not Landlord elects to terminate this Lease on account of any default
by Tenant, as set forth in this Article 19, Landlord shall have the right to
terminate any and all subleases, licenses, concessions or other consensual
arrangements for possession entered into by Tenant and affecting the Premises or
may, in Landlord's sole discretion, succeed to Tenant's interest in such
subleases, licenses, concessions or arrangements. In the event of Landlord's
election to succeed to Tenant's interest in any such subleases, licenses,
concessions or arrangements, Tenant shall, as of the date of notice by Landlord
of such election, have no further right to or interest in the rent or other
consideration receivable thereunder.

        19.4 EFFORTS TO RELET. No re-entry or repossession, repairs,
maintenance, changes, alterations and additions, reletting, appointment of a
receiver to protect Landlord's interests hereunder, or any other action or
omission by Landlord shall be construed as an election by Landlord to terminate
this Lease or Tenant's right to possession, or to accept a surrender of the
Premises, nor shall same operate to release Tenant in whole or in part from any
of Tenant's obligations hereunder, unless express written notice of such
intention is sent by Landlord to Tenant. Tenant hereby irrevocably waives any
right otherwise available under any law to redeem or reinstate this Lease.

        19.5 LANDLORD'S DEFAULT. Landlord's failure to perform any of its
obligations under this Lease shall constitute a default by Landlord under the
Lease if the failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice of the
failure from Tenant to Landlord itemizing with reasonable particularity the
basis of such claim. If the required performance is factually required of
Landlord and cannot be completed within thirty (30) days, Landlord's failure to
perform shall constitute a default under the Lease unless Landlord undertakes to
cure the failure within thirty (30) days and diligently and continuously
attempts to complete this cure as soon as reasonably possible.

                           COVENANT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT

        Landlord covenants that, so long as Tenant is not in default hereunder,
Tenant shall, during the Lease Term, peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy
the Premises subject to the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions and
agreements hereof without interference by any persons lawfully claiming by or
through Landlord.

                                SECURITY DEPOSIT

        In lieu of a cash deposit, Tenant shall, pursuant to the provisions of
Article 31 of this Lease, deposit with Landlord the "Letter of Credit" defined
in said Article 31 to serve as security for the faithful performance by Tenant
of all of its obligations under this Lease. Any reference in this Lease to the
term "Security Deposit" shall mean and refer to the Letter of Credit.

                                      SIGNS

        23.1 FULL FLOORS. Subject to Landlord's prior written approval, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and provided all signs are in
keeping with the quality, design and style of the Building and Project, Tenant,
if the Premises comprise an entire floor of the Building, at its sole cost and
expense, may install identification signage anywhere in the


                                      -39-
<PAGE>   43

Premises, including in the elevator lobby of the Premises, provided that such
signs must not be visible from the exterior of the Building; provided, however,
that Landlord shall at all times provide at least one (1) sign or directory in
the elevator lobby of such Premises displaying the name and suite number of
Tenant.

        23.2 MULTI-TENANT FLOORS. If other tenants occupy space on the floor on
which the Premises is located, Tenant's identifying signage shall be provided by
Landlord, at Tenant's cost, and such signage shall be comparable to that used by
Landlord for other similar floors in the Building and shall comply with
Landlord's then-current Building standard signage program.

        23.3 EXTERIOR SIGNAGE. Tenant, at Tenant's sole expense, shall have the
exclusive right to install two (2) prominent back-lit building parapet signs
(facing north and south), as well as the non-exclusive right to install one (1)
blank side strip on both the east and west facing sides of the monuments located
on the Project at Washington Street and Van Buren Street for a total of four (4)
strips. TENANT'S SIDE STRIPS SHALL, AT ALL TIMES DURING ITS TENANCY, OCCUPY THE
TOP AND HIGHEST POSITION ON SUCH MONUMENTS (ALL AS MORE PARTICULARLY SHOWN ON
EXHIBIT H ATTACHED). As used in the foregoing sentence, the word "parapet" shall
mean and refer to the architectural feature of the Building which is the
vertical continuation of the exterior skin of the Building for several feet
above the roof line, the function of which is to screen the roof-mounted
equipment, and to which permitted exterior signage is typically affixed.
Landlord hereby agrees that Tenant shall have the right to transfer its parapet
and monument exterior signage rights to an Affiliate, or an assignee of Tenant
which is approved by Landlord pursuant to the provisions of Article 14 above.
Said signage will be subject to Landlord's reasonable approval on design,
specification, size, location and proposed language. Further, Tenant shall have
the exclusive right to rooftop signage (i.e., viewable only from above) on
Building B, subject to Landlord's reasonable approval on design, specification,
size and location thereof. Landlord hereby agreed that Tenant shall have the
right to transfer its roof top signage rights to an Affiliate or an assignee of
Tenant. All such exterior signage shall be further subject to the approval of
the applicable governmental authorities with jurisdiction.

        23.4 PROHIBITED SIGNAGE AND OTHER ITEMS. Subject to the requirements of
any federal, state, county, city or governmental agency law, statute, ordinance,
standard, rule, or order now in effect or hereafter issued, any signs, notices,
logos, pictures, names or advertisements which are installed and that have not
been separately approved by Landlord may be removed without notice by Landlord
at the sole expense of Tenant. Except as specifically provided in Section 23.3
above, Tenant may not install any signs on the exterior or roof of the Project
or the Common Areas. Any signs, window coverings, or blinds (even if the same
are located behind the Landlord-approved window coverings for the Building), or
other items visible from the exterior of the Premises or Building, shall be
subject to the prior approval of Landlord, in its sole discretion.

        23.5 BUILDING DIRECTORY. Landlord shall maintain, at Landlord's expense
a building directory located in the lobby of the Building. Tenant shall have the
right to designate name strips to be displayed under Tenant's entry in such
directory at a rate which is in proportion to Tenant's occupancy of rentable
square feet in the Premises.

                               COMPLIANCE WITH LAW

        Tenant shall not do anything or suffer anything to be done in or about
the Premises or the Project which will in any way conflict with any law,
statute, ordinance or other governmental rule, regulation or requirement now in
force or which may hereafter be enacted or promulgated. At its sole cost and
expense, Tenant shall promptly comply with all such governmental measures to the
extent that such relate to or are triggered by Tenant's particular use of the
Premises, the Tenant Improvements located in the Premises, or any Alterations
located in the Premises; otherwise such compliance shall be undertaken by
Landlord as, to the extent specifically allowed under this Lease, an Operating
Expense. Should any standard or regulation now or hereafter be imposed on
Landlord or Tenant by a state, federal or local governmental body charged with
the establishment, regulation and enforcement of occupational, health or safety
standards for employers, employees, landlords or tenants, then Tenant agrees, at
its sole cost and expense, to comply promptly with such standards or regulations
to the extent that such relate to or are triggered by Tenant's particular use of
the Premises, the Tenant Improvements located in the Premises, or any
Alterations located in the Premises; otherwise such compliance shall be
undertaken by Landlord as, to the extent specifically allowed under this Lease,
an Operating Expense (unless Landlord is required to undertake such compliance
in Landlord's performance of its repair obligations pursuant to the provisions
of this Lease). Tenant shall be responsible, at its sole cost and expense, to
make all alterations to the Premises as are required to comply with the
governmental rules, regulations, requirements or standards described in this
Article 24 to the extent that such relate to or are triggered by Tenant's
particular use of the Premises, the Tenant Improvements located in the Premises,
or any Alterations located in the Premises; otherwise such compliance shall be
undertaken by Landlord as, to the extent specifically allowed under this Lease,
an Operating Expense. The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or the
admission of Tenant in any judicial action, regardless of whether Landlord is a
party thereto, that Tenant has violated any of said governmental measures, shall
be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant. Landlord, at
Landlord's sole expense, shall, as soon as reasonably possible, make all
repairs, replacements, alterations, or improvements reasonably necessary to
comply with all governmental rules, regulations, requirements or standards
described in this Article 24 to the extent such relate to the Building or the
Project. As of the date of execution of this Lease, Landlord has not received
(i) any notices from any governmental or quasi-governmental agency alleging any
violation of any applicable laws (including Americans With Disabilities Act
("ADA") and Environmental Laws), rules, ordinances, regulations, and other
applicable requirements pertaining to the Project or any portion thereof, (ii)
any notices of any claims made or threatened regarding noncompliance with any
applicable laws (including ADA and Environmental Laws), rules, ordinances,
regulations, and other applicable requirements pertaining to the Project or any
portion thereof, or (iii) any notices of any governmental or regulatory actions
or investigations instituted or threatened regarding noncompliance with any
applicable laws (including ADA and Environmental Laws), rules, ordinances,
regulations, and other applicable requirements pertaining to the Project or any
portion thereof.

                                  LATE CHARGES

        If any installment of Rent or any other sum due from Tenant shall not be
received by Landlord or Landlord's designee within five (5) business days after
said amount is due, then, upon invoice by Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord
a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the overdue amount plus any
reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant's failure to
pay Rent and/or other charges when due hereunder; provided that for any
consecutive twelve (12) month period of the Lease Term, Landlord shall provide
one (1) five (5) business day late-charge grace period following delivery of
written notice to Tenant that such payment has not been timely received. The
late charge shall be deemed Additional Rent and the right to require it shall be
in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies hereunder or at law
and shall not be construed as liquidated damages or as limiting Landlord's
remedies in any manner. In addition to the late charge described above, any Rent
or other amounts owing hereunder which are not paid within ten (10) days after
the date they are due shall bear interest from the date when due until paid at a
rate per annum equal to the lesser of (i) the annual "Bank Prime Loan" rate
cited in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release Publication G.13(415),
published on the first Tuesday of each calendar month (or such other comparable
index as Landlord and Tenant shall reasonably agree upon if such rate ceases to
be published) plus two (2) percentage points, and (ii) the highest rate
permitted by applicable law.

              LANDLORD'S RIGHT TO CURE DEFAULT; PAYMENTS BY TENANT

        26.1 LANDLORD'S CURE. All covenants and agreements to be kept or
performed by Tenant under this Lease shall be performed by Tenant at Tenant's
sole cost and expense and without any reduction of Rent, except to the extent,
if any, otherwise expressly provided herein. If Tenant shall fail to perform any
obligation under this Lease, and such failure shall continue in excess of the
time allowed under Section 19.1.2, above, unless a specific time period is
otherwise stated in this Lease, Landlord may, but shall not be obligated to,
make any such payment or perform any such act on Tenant's part without waiving
its rights based upon any default of Tenant and without releasing Tenant from
any obligations hereunder.

        26.2 TENANT'S REIMBURSEMENT. Except as may be specifically provided to
the contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, upon delivery by
Landlord to Tenant of statements therefor: (i) sums equal to expenditures
reasonably made and obligations incurred by Landlord in connection with the
remedying by Landlord of Tenant's defaults pursuant to the provisions of Section
26.1; (ii) sums equal to all losses, costs, liabilities, damages and expenses
referred to in Article 10 of this Lease; and (iii) sums equal to all
expenditures made and obligations incurred by Landlord in collecting or
attempting to collect the Rent or in enforcing or attempting to enforce any
rights of Landlord under this Lease or pursuant to law, including, without
limitation, all reasonable legal fees and other amounts so expended. Tenant's
obligations under this Section 26.2 shall survive the expiration or sooner
termination of the Lease Term.

                                ENTRY BY LANDLORD

        27.1 ENTRY BY LANDLORD. Landlord reserves the right at all reasonable
times and upon twenty-four (24) hours' written notice to Tenant (except in the
case of an emergency) to enter the Premises to (i) inspect the Premises; (ii)
show the Premises to prospective purchasers, current or prospective mortgagees,
ground or underlying lessors or insurers; (iii) post notices of
nonresponsibility; (iv) alter, improve or repair the Premises or the Building if
necessary to comply with this Lease, building codes or other laws, or make
necessary repairs to the Building or the Building's structural systems and
equipment; or (v) show the Premises during the final nine (9) months of the
Lease Term to prospective tenants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article 27, Landlord may enter the Premises at any time to (A)
perform services required of Landlord, including janitorial service; (B) take
possession due to any uncured event of Default under this Lease; and (C) perform
any covenants of Tenant which Tenant fails to perform. Landlord may make any
such entries without the abatement of Rent, except as otherwise provided in this
Lease, and may take such reasonable steps as required to accomplish the stated
purposes. Tenant hereby waives any claims for damages or for any injuries or
inconvenience to or interference with Tenant's business, lost profits, any loss
of occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the Premises. For entry permitted under this
Article 26, Landlord shall at all times have a key with which to unlock all the
doors in the Premises, excluding Tenant's vaults, safes and special security
areas designated in advance by Tenant. In an emergency, Landlord shall have the
right to use any means that Landlord may deem proper to open the doors in and to
the Premises. Any such entry into the Premises by Landlord in the manner
hereinbefore described shall not be deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry
into, or a detainer of, the Premises, or an actual or constructive eviction of
Tenant from any portion of the Premises. To the extent reasonably practicable,
Landlord shall exercise its rights under this Section 27.1 at such times and in
such a manner as to minimize the impact on Tenant's business in and occupancy of
the Premises and at all time in conformity with National Banking Act
regulations.

        27.2 TENANT'S SPECIAL SECURITY AREAS. The following areas, together with
any additional areas which Tenant may from time to time designate in writing to
Landlord, are "Tenant's Special Security Areas": Money Desk Area and Federal
Wire Area. Except in an emergency posing a threat of imminent bodily harm or
property damage or when accompanied by an authorized representative of Tenant
(and subject to the notice requirements of Section 27.1 above) Landlord shall
not enter Tenant's Special Security Areas.

                                   ARTICLE 28

                                 TENANT PARKING

        Tenant shall have the right, at no cost to Tenant (other than with
respect to the Reserve Parking Right below), commencing on the Lease
Commencement Date, to the use of up to the amount of parking spaces set forth in
Section 9 of the Summary, on a monthly basis throughout the Lease Term, which
parking spaces shall be located in the Project parking facility. During any
Renewal Term, Tenant shall be entitled to the same ratio of parking space [ * ].


                                      -43-
<PAGE>   47
In lieu of an equal number of unreserved parking spaces, Tenant shall rent at
least [ * ] and up to [ * ] reserved parking spaces in the Project parking
facility on a monthly basis throughout the Lease Term (the "RESERVED PARKING
RIGHT"). The location of the reserved parking spaces shall be in an area
mutually agreed to by Landlord and Tenant, giving the utmost consideration to
Tenant's preference whenever possible within the confines of already existing
parking contracts, within thirty (30) days following execution of this Lease ,
utilizing the existing canopy covers as mutually agreed upon between Landlord
and Tenant and striped by Landlord per Tenant's reasonable specifications. The
rate for such reserved parking rights shall be [ * ] per stall per month. During
any Renewal Term, Tenant shall have the same Reserved Parking Right at [ * ] per
stall per month. Further, subject to availability, Tenant may rent, on a
month-to-month basis, additional parking spaces for unreserved parking spaces in
the Project parking facility. Tenant may change the number of unreserved parking
spaces rented pursuant to this Article 28 upon at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Landlord, and provided that in no event shall Tenant be
entitled to rent more than the amount of parking spaces set forth in Section 9
of the Summary. Tenant shall pay to Landlord for automobile parking spaces on a
monthly basis the prevailing rate charged from time to time at the location of
such parking spaces. In addition, Tenant shall be responsible for the full
amount of any taxes imposed by any governmental authority in connection with the
renting of such parking spaces by Tenant or the use of the parking facility by
Tenant. Tenant's continued right to use the parking spaces is conditioned upon
Tenant abiding by all rules and regulations which are prescribed from time to
time for the orderly operation and use of the parking facility where the parking
spaces are located, including any sticker or other identification system
established by Landlord and Tenant's cooperation in seeing that Tenant's
employees and visitors also comply with such rules and regulations. Such rules
and regulations shall include appropriate notice and cure provisions and shall
be effective only upon written delivery of a copy of any such rules and
regulations to Tenant. Landlord specifically reserves the right to change the
size, configuration, design, layout (excluding the rate for parking stalls) of
the Project parking facility at any time and Tenant acknowledges and agrees that
Landlord may, without incurring any liability to Tenant and without any
abatement of Rent under this Lease, from time to time, close-off or restrict
access to the Project parking facility for purposes of permitting or
facilitating any such construction, alteration or improvements. Landlord may
delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a parking operator in which case such
parking operator shall have all the rights of control attributed hereby to the
Landlord. The parking spaces allocated to Tenant pursuant to this Article 28 are
provided to Tenant solely for use by Tenant's and Tenant Affiliate's own
personnel and such spaces may not be transferred, assigned, subleased or
otherwise alienated by Tenant without Landlord's prior approval, except in
connection with an approved sublease or assignment, which provides to the
Transferee a pro-rata share of Tenant's parking rights. Tenant shall be allowed
to use Tenant Parking on a twenty-four (24) hour seven (7) day per week basis.

        29.1 TERMS; CAPTIONS. The words "Landlord" and "Tenant" as used herein

as the case may require, shall in all cases be assumed as though in each case
fully expressed. The captions of Articles and Sections are for convenience only
and shall not be deemed to limit, construe, affect or alter the meaning of such
Articles and Sections.

        29.2 BINDING EFFECT. Subject to Article 14 and Sections 29.5 and 29.13
of this Lease, each of the covenants, conditions and provisions of this Lease
shall extend to and shall, as the case may require, bind or inure to the benefit
not only of Landlord and of Tenant, but also of their respective heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns.

        29.3 NO AIR RIGHTS. No rights to any view or to light or air over any
property, whether belonging to Landlord or any other person, are granted to
Tenant by this Lease. If at any time any windows of the Premises are temporarily
darkened or the light or view therefrom is obstructed by reason of any repairs,
maintenance or cleaning in or about the Project, there shall be no liability to
Landlord and no reduction or diminution of Tenant's obligations under this
Lease; provided, however, that there is no unreasonable interference with
Tenant' use of the Premises.

        29.4 MODIFICATION OF LEASE. Should any current or prospective mortgagee
or ground lessor for the Building or Project require a modification of this
Lease, which modification will not cause an increased cost or expense to Tenant
or in any other way materially and adversely change the rights and obligations
of Tenant or Landlord hereunder, then and in such event, Tenant agrees that this
Lease may be so modified and agrees to execute whatever documents are reasonably
required therefor and to deliver the same to Landlord within ten (10) business
days following a request therefor. At the request of Landlord or any mortgagee
or ground lessor, Tenant agrees to execute a short form of Lease and deliver the
same to Landlord within ten (10) business days following the request therefor.

        29.5 TRANSFER OF LANDLORD'S INTEREST. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord
has the right to transfer all or any portion of its interest in the Project or
Building and in this Lease, and Tenant agrees that in the event of any such
transfer, Landlord shall automatically be released from all liability under this
Lease that accrues after the effective date of transfer, subject to the
following restrictions: (i) Landlord shall not be released from its obligations
under this Lease unless the transferee agrees in writing, for the benefit of
Tenant, to assume Landlord's obligations under this Lease from and after the
date of the transfer; (ii) if Landlord assigns its interest in this Lease to a
lender as additional security, this assignment shall not release Landlord from
its obligations under this Lease; and (iii) if the Premises and Building are not
built at the time this Lease is executed, this Section 29.5(iii) shall not apply
to any transfer of Landlord's interest within twelve (12) months after the date
on which Landlord completes construction of the Premises and Building, as
required by the Lease. If Landlord transfers or mortgages its interest in the
Premises, Landlord shall transfer or assign the Letter of Credit to Landlord's
transferee and thereupon be relieved of further responsibility with respect to
the Letter of Credit as long as the transferee agrees in writing to hold the
Letter of Credit under the provisions of this Section 29.5. If Landlord fails to
transfer or assign the Letter of Credit, Tenant shall not be required to replace
the Letter of Credit until the expiration of the Letter of Credit. If Landlord
draws on the Letter of Credit after a transfer or an assignment, the transferee
shall pay to Tenant within ten (10) days from the date of the draw the amount of
the Letter of Credit. If the transferee fails to pay Tenant the amount of the
Letter of Credit within that period, Tenant may


                                      -45-
<PAGE>   49
deduct the amount of the Letter of Credit from the Rent payable by Tenant. If
Landlord fails to transfer or assign the Letter of Credit or the transferee does
not credit Tenant for the amount of the Letter of Credit, Tenant may deduct from
the Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease the amount of the Letter of Credit.
To the extent consistent with the foregoing, Tenant agrees to look solely to
such transferee for the performance of Landlord's obligations hereunder after
the date of transfer and such transferee shall be deemed to have fully assumed
and be liable for all obligations of this Lease to be performed by Landlord;
provided, however, that no such attornment shall be effective unless and until
such transferee executes and delivers to Tenant a commercially reasonable
non-disturbance agreement following good-faith negotiations between Tenant and
such transferee.

        29.6 PROHIBITION AGAINST RECORDING. Except as provided in Section 29.4
of this Lease, neither this Lease, nor any memorandum, affidavit or other
writing with respect thereto, shall be recorded by Tenant or by anyone acting
through, under or on behalf of Tenant.

        29.7 LANDLORD'S TITLE. Landlord's title is and always shall be paramount
to the title of Tenant. Nothing herein contained shall empower Tenant to do any
act which can, shall or may encumber the title of Landlord.

        29.8 RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES. Nothing contained in this Lease shall be
deemed or construed by the parties hereto or by any third party to create the
relationship of principal and agent, partnership, joint venturer or any
association between Landlord and Tenant.

        29.9 APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. Landlord shall have the right to apply
payments received from Tenant pursuant to this Lease, regardless of Tenant's
designation of such payments, to satisfy any obligations of Tenant hereunder, in
such order and amounts as Landlord, in its sole discretion, may elect.

        29.10 TIME OF ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect to the
performance of every provision of this Lease in which time of performance is a
factor.

        29.11 PARTIAL INVALIDITY. If any term, provision or condition contained
in this Lease shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Lease, or the application of such term, provision or condition to
persons or circumstances other than those with respect to which it is invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each and every other term,
provision and condition of this Lease shall be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent possible permitted by law.

        29.12 NO WARRANTY. Except to the extent specifically provided to the
contrary in this Lease, Tenant hereby represents that, in executing and
delivering this Lease, Tenant has not relied on any representations, including,
but not limited to, any representation as to the amount of any item comprising
Additional Rent or the amount of the Additional Rent in the aggregate or that
Landlord is furnishing the same services to other tenants, at all, on the same
level or on the same basis, or any warranty or any statement of Landlord which
is not set forth herein or in one or more of the exhibits attached hereto.

        29.13 LANDLORD EXCULPATION. The liability of Landlord or the Landlord
Parties to Tenant for any default by Landlord under this Lease or arising in
connection herewith or with


                                      -46-
<PAGE>   50

Landlord's operation, management, leasing, repair, renovation, alteration or any
other matter relating to the Project or the Premises shall be limited solely and
exclusively to an amount which is equal to the interest of Landlord in the
Building. Neither Landlord, nor any of the Landlord Parties shall have any
personal liability therefor, and Tenant hereby expressly waives and releases
such personal liability on behalf of itself and all persons claiming by, through
or under Tenant. The limitations of liability contained in this Section 29.13
shall inure to the benefit of Landlord's and the Landlord Parties' present and
future partners, beneficiaries, officers, directors, trustees, shareholders,
agents and employees, and their respective partners, heirs, successors and
assigns.

        29.14 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. It is understood and acknowledged that there are
no oral agreements between the parties hereto affecting this Lease and this
Lease constitutes the parties' entire agreement with respect to the leasing of
the Premises and supersedes and cancels any and all previous negotiations,
arrangements, brochures, agreements and understandings, if any, between the
parties hereto or displayed by Landlord to Tenant with respect to the subject
matter thereof, and none thereof shall be used to interpret or construe this
Lease. None of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Lease can
be modified, deleted or added to except in writing signed by the parties hereto.

        29.15 RIGHT TO LEASE. Except as specifically restricted in this Lease,
including without limitation Section 29.26, Landlord reserves the absolute right
to effect such other tenancies in the Project as Landlord in the exercise of its
sole business judgment shall determine to best promote the interests of the
Building or Project. Tenant does not rely on the fact, nor does Landlord
represent, that any specific tenant or type or number of tenants shall, during
the Lease Term, occupy any space in the Building or Project.

        29.16 FORCE MAJEURE. Any prevention, delay or stoppage due to strikes,
lockouts, labor disputes, acts of God, inability to obtain services, labor, or
materials or reasonable substitutes therefor, governmental actions, civil
commotions, fire or other casualty, and other causes beyond the reasonable
control of the party obligated to perform, except with respect to the
obligations imposed on Landlord or Tenant with regard to payment of money under
this Lease (collectively, a "Force Majeure"), notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Lease, shall excuse the performance of such party for
a period equal to any such prevention, delay or stoppage and, therefore, if this
Lease specifies a time period for performance of an obligation of either party,
that time period shall be extended by the period of any delay in such party's
performance caused by a Force Majeure.

        29.17 WAIVER OF REDEMPTION BY TENANT. Tenant hereby waives, for Tenant
and for all those claiming under Tenant, any and all rights now or hereafter
existing to redeem by order or judgment of any court or by any legal process or
writ, Tenant's right of occupancy of the Premises after any termination of this
Lease.

        29.18 NOTICES. All notices, demands, statements, designations, approvals

under this Lease shall be joint and several.

        29.20 AUTHORITY. Each of the persons executing this Lease on behalf of
an entity does hereby represent and warrant that such entity is a duly
authorized and existing entity, that the entity has and is qualified to do
business in the State of Arizona, that the entity has full right and authority
to execute and deliver this Lease, and that each person signing on behalf of the
entity was authorized to do so. Each party shall, within ten (10) days after the
execution and delivery of this Lease, deliver to the other party satisfactory
evidence of (i) such authority, (ii) good standing in such entity's state of
formation, and (iii) qualification to do business in the State of Arizona.

should bring suit for the possession of the Premises, for the recovery of any
sum due under this Lease, or because of the breach of any provision of this
Lease or for any other relief against the other, then all costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by the prevailing party therein
shall be paid by the other party, which obligation on the part of the other
party shall be deemed to have accrued on the date of the commencement of such
action and shall be enforceable whether or not the action is prosecuted to
judgment.

        29.22 GOVERNING LAW; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. This Lease shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona. IN
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREFROM, LANDLORD AND TENANT HEREBY CONSENT TO

SERVICE OF PROCESS BY ANY MEANS AUTHORIZED BY ARIZONA LAW, AND (III) IN THE
INTEREST OF SAVING TIME AND EXPENSE, TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY IN ANY ACTION,

<PAGE>   53

WITH THIS LEASE, THE RELATIONSHIP OF LANDLORD AND TENANT, TENANT'S USE OR
OCCUPANCY OF THE PREMISES, AND/OR ANY CLAIM FOR INJURY OR DAMAGE, OR ANY
EMERGENCY OR STATUTORY REMEDY. IN THE EVENT LANDLORD COMMENCES ANY SUMMARY
PROCEEDINGS OR ACTION FOR NONPAYMENT OF BASE RENT OR ADDITIONAL RENT, TENANT
SHALL NOT INTERPOSE ANY COUNTERCLAIM OF ANY NATURE OR DESCRIPTION (UNLESS SUCH
COUNTERCLAIM SHALL BE MANDATORY) IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING OR ACTION, BUT SHALL BE
RELEGATED TO AN INDEPENDENT ACTION AT LAW.

        29.23 SUBMISSION OF LEASE. Submission of this instrument for examination
or signature by Tenant does not constitute a reservation of, option for or
option to lease, and it is not effective as a lease or otherwise until execution
and delivery by both Landlord and Tenant.

        29.24 BROKERS. Landlord and Tenant hereby warrant to each other that
they have had no dealings with any real estate broker or agent in connection
with the negotiation of this Lease, except the real estate brokers or agents
specified in Section 12 of the Summary (the "Brokers"), and that they know of no
other real estate broker or agent who is entitled to a commission in connection
with this Lease. Each party agrees to indemnify and defend the other party
against and hold the other party harmless from any and all claims, demands,
losses, liabilities, lawsuits, judgments, costs and expenses (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) with respect to any leasing commission or
equivalent compensation alleged to be owing on account of any dealings with any
real estate broker or agent, other than the Brokers, occurring by, through, or
under the indemnifying party. The terms of this Section 29.24 shall survive the
expiration or earlier termination of the Lease.

        29.25 INDEPENDENT COVENANTS. This Lease shall be construed as though the
covenants herein between Landlord and Tenant are independent and not dependent
and Tenant hereby expressly waives the benefit of any statute to the contrary
and agrees that if Landlord fails to perform its obligations set forth herein,
Tenant shall not be entitled to make any repairs or perform any acts hereunder
at Landlord's expense or to any setoff of the Rent or other amounts owing
hereunder against Landlord.

        29.26 PROJECT OR BUILDING NAME AND SIGNAGE. Subject to the provisions of
Article 23 of this Lease, Landlord shall have the right at any time to change
the name of the Project or Building and to install, affix and maintain any and
all signs on the exterior and on the interior of the Project or Building as
Landlord may, in Landlord's sole discretion, desire; provided, however, that, so
long as Tenant is occupying at least 65,000 rentable square feet in the Project,
Tenant shall have an "exclusive" and Landlord shall not have the right to lease
space in Building B to any call center or financial services entities (excluding
call centers or financial services entities to which existing (as of the date of
this Lease) tenants in Building B elect to sublease space or assign their
interests in their respective leases with Landlord's reasonable approval) or to
change the name of the Project or the Building without Tenant's prior approval,
which approval shall be in Tenant's sole discretion. Landlord's rights hereunder
shall be subject to Tenant's signage rights under Article 23. Tenant shall not
use the name of the Project or Building or use pictures or illustrations of the
Project or Building in advertising or other publicity or for any purpose other
than as the address of the business to be conducted by Tenant in the Premises,
without the prior written consent of Landlord.

        29.27 COUNTERPARTS. This Lease may be executed in counterparts with the
same effect as if both parties hereto had executed the same document. Both
counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute a single lease.

        29.28 CONFIDENTIALITY. Both parties acknowledge that the content of this
Lease and any related documents are confidential information. Both parties shall
keep such confidential information strictly confidential and shall not disclose
such confidential information, other than the identification of the parties, the
building name and its location, to any person or entity other than such party's
financial, legal, and space planning consultants.

        29.29 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT.

               29.29.1 SUBDIVISION. Landlord reserves the right to further
subdivide all or a portion of the Project. Tenant agrees to execute and deliver,
upon demand by Landlord and in the form requested by Landlord, any additional
documents needed to conform this Lease to the circumstances resulting from such
subdivision; provided, however, that nothing required herein shall materially
affect Tenant's right under this Lease and that Landlord shall reimburse Tenant
for Tenant's reasonable costs in connection with such execution and delivery.

               29.29.2 THE OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. If portions of the Project or
property adjacent to the Project (collectively, the "OTHER IMPROVEMENTS") are
owned by an entity other than Landlord, Landlord, at its option, may enter into
an agreement with the owner or owners of any or all of the Other Improvements to
provide (i) for reciprocal rights of access and/or use of the Project and the
Other Improvements, (ii) for the common management, operation, maintenance,
improvement and/or repair of all or any portion of the Project and the Other
Improvements, (iii) for the allocation of a portion of the Direct Expenses to
the Other Improvements and the operating expenses and taxes for the Other
Improvements to the Project, and (iv) for the use or improvement of the Other
Improvements and/or the Project in connection with the improvement,
construction, and/or excavation of the Other Improvements and/or the Project.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to limit or otherwise
affect Landlord's right to convey all or any portion of the Project or any other
of Landlord's rights described in this Lease, provided that any such conveyance
does not materially and unreasonably interfere with Tenant's use of the Premises
and does not result in any additional monetary obligation on the part of Tenant
other than minor administrative compliance costs.

               29.29.3 CONSTRUCTION OF PROJECT AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. Tenant
acknowledges that portions of the Project and/or the Other Improvements may be
under construction following Tenant's occupancy of the Premises, and that such
construction may result in levels of noise, dust, obstruction of access, etc.
which are in excess of that present in a fully constructed project but which
shall not unreasonably and materially interfere with Tenant's use of the
Premises.

        29.30 BUILDING RENOVATIONS. It is specifically understood and agreed
that Landlord has no obligation and has made no promises to alter, remodel,
improve, renovate, repair or decorate the Premises, Building, or any part
thereof and that no representations respecting the condition of the Premises or
the Building have been made by Landlord to Tenant except as specifically set
forth herein or in the Tenant Work Letter. However, Tenant hereby acknowledges
that Landlord


                                      -51-
<PAGE>   55

is currently renovating or may during the Lease Term renovate, improve, alter,
or modify (collectively, the "RENOVATIONS") the Project, the Building and/or the
Premises.

        29.31 NO VIOLATION. Tenant hereby warrants and represents that neither
its execution of nor performance under this Lease shall cause Tenant to be in
violation of any agreement, instrument, contract, law, rule or regulation by
which Tenant is bound, and Tenant shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold
Landlord harmless against any claims, demands, losses, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs, arising from Tenant's breach of this warranty and representation.

        29.32 COMMUNICATIONS AND TELECOM EQUIPMENT. Tenant may install,
maintain, replace, remove or use any communications or computer wires and
cables, fiber optic cable, microwave satellite dishes or other
telecommunications devices and/or services to the Premises (collectively, the
"TELECOM EQUIPMENT") at the Project or in or serving the Premises, provided that
(i) such installation, if any, shall be undertaken pursuant to the provisions of
either the Tenant Work Letter attached hereto as EXHIBIT B or the alterations
provisions set forth in Article 8 above, (ii) an acceptable number of spare
Telecom Equipment and space for additional Telecom Equipment shall be maintained
for existing and future occupants of the Project, as determined in Landlord's
reasonable opinion, (iii) the Telecom Equipment therefor (including riser
cables) shall be appropriately insulated to prevent excessive electromagnetic
fields or radiation, and shall be surrounded by a protective conduit reasonably
acceptable to Landlord, (iv) any new or existing Telecom Equipment servicing the
Premises shall comply with all applicable governmental laws and regulations, (v)
as a condition to permitting the installation of new Telecom Equipment, Landlord
may require that Tenant remove existing Telecom Equipment located in or serving
the Premises and repair any damage in connection with such removal, and (vi)
Tenant shall pay all reasonable costs in connection therewith; provided,
however, that, as to the Premises, Landlord shall not charge any fees either to
Tenant or to any third party telecommunications service providers associated
with the installation of fiber optic cable, microwave satellite dishes or other
telecommunications devices and/or services to the Premises. The method of
installation of said Tenant's cabling/phone wiring/satellite dishes, etc. shall
be subject to Landlord's reasonable approval. Landlord reserves the right to
require that Tenant remove any Telecom Equipment located in or serving the
Premises which are installed in violation of these provisions, or which are at
any time in violation of any laws or represent a dangerous or potentially
dangerous condition. Landlord acknowledges that Tenant desires an expeditious
review and approval process by Landlord in connection with the Telecom Equipment
proposed to be installed or modified at the Premises by Tenant.

        29.33 GENERATOR AND TANK. Subject to Landlord's reasonable approval of
design, specification and size, and subject to all applicable governmental laws
and regulations, Tenant has the right to install (i) a generator and (ii) an
associated so-called "belly" fuel tank at the location indicated on EXHIBIT G,
or such other location as required by the City of Phoenix . Tenant shall provide
appropriate insurance coverage for such generator and tank as reasonably
required by Landlord after consultation between Landlord's and Tenant's
respective insurance representatives. Landlord shall provide an "expeditor" to
assist Tenant in obtaining necessary City of Phoenix approval

                                   ARTICLE 30

                                OPTIONS TO EXTEND

        30.1 OPTION RIGHTS. Landlord hereby grants Tenant two (2) consecutive
options to extend the then current Lease Term for the entire Premises for
periods of three (3) years each (together the "Option Terms"), which options
shall be exercisable only by written Exercise Notice (as defined below)
delivered by Tenant to Landlord as provided below, provided that, as of the date
of delivery of such Exercise Notice, Tenant is not then in a state of uncured
monetary or other default following the expiration of the applicable cure
periods under the Lease. Upon the proper exercise of such option to extend, and
provided that, as of the end of the then current Lease Term, Tenant is not in
default, as described above, under the Lease, the then current Lease Term shall
be extended for the Option Term.

        30.2 OPTION RENT. The annual base rent payable by Tenant during the
Option Term (the "Option Rent") shall be equal to [*] which for purposes hereof
means [*]








All other terms and conditions of the Lease shall apply throughout the Option
Term; provided, however, any obligation of Landlord to construct tenant
improvements or provide an allowance shall not apply during the Option Term,
except to the extent such provisions are included in [*], and Tenant shall, in
no event, have the option to extend the then current Lease Term beyond the
Option Term described in Section 30.1 above.

        30.3 EXERCISE OF OPTIONS. The option contained in this Article 30 shall
be exercised by Tenant, if at all, on or before the date (the "Exercise Date")
which is at least nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the then current
Lease Term by delivering written notice ("Exercise Notice") thereof to Landlord.
The Exercise Notice may not be delivered earlier than twelve (12) months prior
to the expiration of the then current Lease Term. Tenant may notify Landlord
earlier than the Exercise Date of its intent to exercise its option and Landlord
will work with Tenant to establish [*] at that time. After the Exercise Date,
the parties shall follow the procedure and [*] shall be determined as set forth
in Section 30.4 below. Tenant's failure to deliver the Exercise Notice on or
before the Exercise Date shall be deemed to constitute Tenant's waiver of its
extension right hereunder.

        30.4 Determination of Option Rent. Landlord and Tenant shall attempt to
agree upon [*], using their best good-faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail
to reach agreement upon [*] within fifteen (15) business days following Tenant's
delivery of the Exercise Notice (the "Outside Agreement Date"), then each party
shall submit to the other party a separate written determination of [*] within
fifteen (15) business days after the Outside Agreement Date, and such
determinations shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Sections
30.4.1 through 30.4.7 below. Failure of Tenant or Landlord to submit

                                      -53-
<PAGE>   57
a written determination of [*] within such fifteen (15) business day period
shall conclusively be deemed to be the non-determining party's approval of [*]
submitted within such fifteen (15) business day period by the other party.

               30.4.1 Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one arbitrator who
shall by profession be an independent real estate broker who shall individually
have no ongoing business relationship with Tenant or Landlord and who shall have
been active over the eight (8) year period ending on the date of such
appointment in the leasing of first-class office buildings in the Project Area.
The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of
whether Landlord's or Tenant's submitted [*] is the closest to the actual [*] as
determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of Section
30.2. Each such arbitrator shall be appointed within thirty (30) days after the
Outside Agreement Date.

               30.4.2 The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall within ten (10)
business days of the date of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator
agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same
criteria as set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two (2)
arbitrators.

               30.4.3 The three (3) arbitrators shall within thirty (30) days
after the appointment of the third arbitrator reach a decision as to whether
Landlord's or Tenant's submitted [*] is the closest to the actual [*], and shall
use the closest of Landlord's or Tenant's submitted [*] as [*] for purposes of
calculating the Option Rent, and shall notify Landlord and Tenant thereof.

               30.4.4 The decision of the majority of the three (3) arbitrators
shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.

               30.4.5 If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an
arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the Outside Agreement Date, the
arbitrator appointed by one of them shall reach a decision, notify Landlord and
Tenant thereof, and such arbitrator's decision shall be binding upon Landlord
and Tenant.

               30.4.6 If the two (2) arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint
a third arbitrator within the time period provided in Section 30.2 above, then
the parties shall mutually select the third arbitrator, who shall be qualified
under the same criteria as set forth in Section 30.4.1 above. If Landlord and
Tenant are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within ten (10) days, then
either party may, upon at least five (5) days' prior written notice to the other
party, request the Presiding Judge of the Superior Court of the County which the
Project is located, acting in his private and nonjudicial capacity, to appoint
the third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria as set forth
in Section 30.4.1. Following the appointment of the third arbitrator, the panel
of arbitrators shall within thirty (30) days thereafter reach a decision as to
whether Landlord's or Tenant's submitted [*] shall be used and shall notify
Landlord and Tenant thereof.

               30.4.7 The cost of the arbitrators and the arbitration proceeding
shall be paid by the non-prevailing party.

                                LETTER OF CREDIT

        31.1 LETTER OF CREDIT. Within five (5) business days of mutual execution
of this Lease by Landlord and Tenant, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord an
irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of One Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000) ("Letter of Credit") as additional security for
the faithful performance by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease. The
Letter of Credit shall be upon the terms and subject to the following provisions
of this Article 31.

               31.1.1 If Tenant fails to pay Rent or other charges due hereunder
beyond any applicable cure periods, or otherwise defaults beyond any applicable
cure periods with respect to any provision of this Lease, in addition to any
other rights held by Landlord, Landlord may draw upon and apply all or any part
of the Letter of Credit as is necessary to the payment of any actual Rent or
other charge in default. Any draw under the Section 31.1.1 shall be Landlord's
exclusive remedy with respect to such failure to pay Rent or other charges due.
failure to do so shall be a default under this Lease.

               31.1.2 The Letter of Credit shall commence five (5) business days
after mutual execution of this Lease and, unless otherwise released pursuant to
Article 31.1.2.3 below, Tenant shall renew the Letter of Credit from time to
time through the initial Term, at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration
thereof and deliver to Landlord a new Letter of Credit or an endorsement to the
Letter of Credit and any other evidence required by Landlord that the Letter of
Credit has been renewed. The Letter of Credit shall be (i) issued by a bank
reasonably approved by Landlord ("Bank"), with Landlord hereby approving [*],
with draws permitted to be presented at any major branch thereof located in
California or Arizona, and (ii) in a form containing the required provisions set
forth in Article 31.1.2.1 through 31.1.2.4 below. The premium or purchase price
of, or any other Bank fees associated with, such Letter of Credit shall be paid
by Tenant. The Letter of Credit shall, without limiting the foregoing, provide
that:

                      31.1.2.1 Such Letter of Credit shall be transferable,
irrevocable and unconditional, so that Landlord, or its successor(s) in interest
with respect to the Premises, may upon an uncured monetary default with respect
to the Rent or any other charge under this Lease, "call" for any portion of the
then uncalled upon amount thereof without regard to and without the Bank
inquiring as to the right or lack of right of the holder of such Letter of
Credit to effect such calls or the existence or lack of existence of any
defenses by Tenant with respect thereto;

                      31.1.2.2 Landlord agrees not to draw upon the Letter of
Credit unless Landlord certifies monetary default by Tenant under the Lease
after giving notice thereof to Tenant in accordance with the terms of this Lease
and the expiration of any applicable cure period set forth in this Lease, but if
Landlord does effect such a "draw," such "draw" amount shall be limited to the
amount necessary to compensate Landlord for such default, as permitted by law or
this Lease.

<PAGE>   59
                      31.1.2.3 Any failure or delay of Landlord to "draw" any
portion of the Letter of Credit shall not act as a waiver of Landlord's right to
do so at any time thereafter or constitute a waiver of any default with respect
to the Lease.

                      31.1.2.4 Tenant agrees not to interfere in any way with
payment to Landlord of the proceeds of the Letter of Credit, either prior to or
following a "draw" by Landlord of any portion of the Letter of Credit,
regardless of whether any dispute exists between Tenant and Landlord as to
Landlord's right to "draw" from the Letter of Credit; provided, however, that
Tenant shall have the right to take action against Landlord if Tenant disputes
Landlord's right to have received such payment or the amount which Landlord has
drawn, as provided herein, after such draw has occurred. No condition or term of
this Lease shall be deemed to render the Letter of Credit conditional upon this
Lease or to justify the issuer of the Letter of Credit in failing to honor a
draw upon such Letter of Credit in a timely manner. In the event Landlord is
determined through any dispute resolution procedure agreed upon by the parties
or by a court of competent jurisdiction to have improperly drawn on the Letter
of Credit, then Tenant shall be entitled to receive a prompt refund of such
amount from Landlord. Tenant hereby waives any provisions of law, now or
hereafter in force, which provide that Landlord may claim from a security
deposit (including the Letter of Credit) only those sums reasonably necessary to
remedy defaults in the payment of rent, to repair damage caused by Tenant or to
clean the Premises, it being agreed that Landlord may, in addition, claim those
sums reasonably necessary to compensate Landlord for any other loss or damage,
foreseeable or unforeseeable, caused by the act or omission of Tenant or any
officer, employee, agent or invitee of Tenant.

               31.1.3 Release of Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that (i) Tenant shall provide Landlord with quarterly
statements as required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") which show that Tenant's most recent quarter of net income as
established by generally accepted accounting principles excluding non-cash
goodwill amortization and in-process research and development is greater than
zero (the "Qualifying Quarterly Statement"), (ii) Tenant's most recent month-end
Market Cap is greater than [*]; and (iii) Tenant, as of the date of each such
reduction, is not in a state of monetary default under this Lease beyond the
expiration of any applicable notice and cure periods, Tenant shall have the
right to reduce the Letter of Credit as follows: (A) if the requirements of
clauses (i) through (iii) above have been met, then, as to the next following
[*] of the Lease Term, then Tenant shall have the right to reduce the Letter of
Credit to One Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,200,000) (the "First
Reduction"); (B) after the First Reduction, if the requirements of clauses (i)
through (iv) above have been met, then, as to the next following [*] of the
Lease Term, then Tenant shall have the right to further reduce the Letter of
Credit to Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000) (the "Second Reduction"); and
(C) after the Second Reduction, if the requirements of clauses (i) through (iv)
above have been met, then, as to the next following [*] of the Lease Term, then
Tenant shall have the right to further reduce the Letter of Credit to Six
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($600,000) (the "Third Reduction"); and (C) following
the Third Reduction, if the requirements of clauses (i) through (iv) above have
been met, then, as to the next following [*] of the Lease Term, then Tenant
shall have the right to further reduce the Letter of Credit to Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) which will represent the base amount of the Letter
of Credit. If the conditions which would qualify the reductions are not met with
respect to the applicable [*], and are met in the subsequent [*]

[*], then the non-effectuated reduction shall occur at the time of the
qualifying reduction, with the effect that Tenant has "caught up" on its
scheduled reductions, notwithstanding the fact that, at the time that the
reduction would otherwise have been effectuated, Tenant had not qualified as
aforesaid.

               31.1.4 Tenant acknowledges and agrees that the Letter of Credit
constitutes a separate and independent contract between Landlord and the Bank,
that Tenant is not a third-party beneficiary of such contract, and that
Landlord's claim under the Letter of Credit for the full amount due and owing
thereunder shall not be, in any way, restricted, limited, altered or impaired by
virtue of any provision of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to,
Section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                               TENANT WORK LETTER

        This Tenant Work Letter shall set forth the terms and conditions
relating to the construction of the tenant improvements in the Premises. This
Tenant Work Letter is essentially organized chronologically and addresses the
issues of the construction of the Premises, in sequence, as such issues may
arise during the actual construction of the Premises. All references in this
Tenant Work Letter to Articles or Sections of "this Lease" shall mean the
relevant portion of that certain Office Lease dated as of March __, 2000,
between CARLYLE AIRPORT TECHNOLOGY TRUST, a Maryland real estate investment
trust, ("Landlord") and NextCard, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Tenant"), to
which this Tenant Work Letter is attached as EXHIBIT B and of which this Tenant
Work Letter forms a part, and all references in this Tenant Work Letter to
Sections of "this Tenant Work Letter" shall mean the relevant portion of this
Tenant Work Letter.

                                    SECTION 1

                 LANDLORD'S INITIAL CONSTRUCTION IN THE PREMISES

        1.1 BASE, SHELL AND CORE. Landlord shall provide the improvements
presently constituting the Project, including the "base, shell, and core," as
defined below, of the Building on which the Premises is located (collectively,
the "Base, Shell, and Core") in accordance with all applicable codes and laws
and in good working order as of the Lease Commencement Date. Tenant shall accept
the Base, Shell and Core in its presently existing, "as is" condition, subject
to latent defects and Landlord completion of any incomplete "punch-list" type
items in accordance with this Section 1.1, which Base, Shell and Core shall
include only the following items:

to be utilized by Tenant without chargeback to the Tenant Improvement Allowance
for the cost of such thermostats.

               1.1.7 Primary electrical system which will service both floors of
the Building in which the Premises are located.

               1.1.8 Life-safety systems, including wet sprinklers in place with

corridor wall which is adjacent to the Premises but only as to that portion of
the Premises, if any, which occupies only a portion of a floor, rather than an
entire floor, of the Building; provided that Landlord shall pay for the cost of
constructing the corridor wall, Tenant shall pay for the finish to the interior
side of all demising and corridor walls with Landlord to be responsible for the
cost of the drywall studs, insulation and any finishes on the exterior, common
area side of the demising and corridor walls.

               1.1.11 Parking areas.

portion of the Tenant Improvement Allowance remains following the completion of
construction the Tenant's Improvements, such amount may be applied by Tenant
toward its architectural and engineering expenses. The Tenant Improvement
Allowance may be allocated at Tenant's election over any portion of the Premises
or phased occupancy thereof (e.g., if the Tenant Improvement construction
process is phased over three (3) areas of the Premises approximately equal in
size and Tenant elects to spend [*] per rentable

square foot on the first phase, there shall be no Tenant Improvement Allowance
for the second or the third phase). In no event shall Landlord be obligated to
make disbursements pursuant to this Tenant Work Letter in a total amount which
exceeds the Tenant Improvement Allowance. Subject to Tenant's rights under
Section 8.5 of the Lease, all Tenant Improvements for which the Tenant
Improvement Allowance has been actually used shall be deemed Landlord's property
under the terms of the Lease.

        2.2 DISBURSEMENT OF THE TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCE. Except as
otherwise set forth in this Tenant Work Letter, the Tenant Improvement Allowance
shall be disbursed by Landlord (each of which disbursements shall be made
pursuant to Landlord's disbursement process, which shall be typical and
customary of the disbursement process for similar improvements being constructed
in the Comparable Buildings, with one draw/reimbursement procedure each month
pursuant to timely submitted and approved invoices with respect to the
construction of the Tenant Improvements, together with full or partial lien
releases as customary under the disbursement standards set forth in this
sentence) for the costs related to the construction of the Tenant Improvements
and for the following items and costs (collectively, the "Tenant Improvement
Allowance Items"): (i) payment of the fees of the "Architect" and the
"Engineers," as those terms are defined in Section 3.1 of this Tenant Work
Letter, and payment of the fees incurred by, and the cost of documents and
materials supplied by, the Architect and Engineers selected by Landlord and
Tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Work Letter in connection with the
preparation and review of the "Construction Drawings," as that term is defined
in Section 3.1 of this Tenant Work Letter; (ii) the cost of any changes in the
Base, Shell and Core when such changes are required by the Construction
Drawings; (iii) the cost of any changes to the Construction Drawings or Tenant
Improvements required by all applicable building codes (the "Code"); (iv) the
"Landlord Supervision Fee", as that term is defined in Section 4.3.2 of this
Tenant Work Letter; and (v) the costs of finishing the tenant side of the
demising and corridor walls, as referenced in Section 1.1.10 above.

        2.3 STANDARD TENANT IMPROVEMENT PACKAGE. Landlord has established
specifications (the "Specifications") for some of the Building standard
components which Tenant may elect to construct in the Premises (collectively,
the "Standard Improvement Package"), which Specifications are set forth in
Schedule 1 hereto. The quality of such Tenant Improvements shall at a minimum
comply with the applicable Specifications.

structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, lifesafety, and sprinkler
work of the Tenant Improvements. The plans and drawings to be prepared by
Architect and the Engineers hereunder shall be known collectively as the
"Construction Drawings." All Construction Drawings shall comply with the drawing
format and specifications as determined by Landlord, and shall be subject to
Landlord's reasonable approval. Tenant and Architect shall verify, in the field,
the dimensions and conditions as shown on the relevant portions of the base
Building plans, and, as between Tenant and Architect, Tenant shall be solely
responsible for the same, and Landlord shall have no responsibility in
connection therewith, except for Landlord Delay (as defined in Section 5.2.8
below). Landlord's review of the Construction Drawings as set forth in this
Section 3, shall be for its sole purpose and shall not imply that Landlord has
reviewed the same, or obligate Landlord to review the same, or impose liability
on Landlord with respect to the review of, the quality, design, Code compliance
or other like matters with respect to the Premises.

        3.2 FINAL SPACE PLAN. On or before the date set forth in Schedule 2,
attached hereto, Tenant and the Architect shall prepare the final space plan for
Tenant Improvements in the Premises (collectively, the "Final Space Plan"),

rooms and other partitioning, their intended use, and equipment to be contained
therein, and shall deliver the Final Space Plan to Landlord for Landlord's
approval.

        3.3 FINAL WORKING DRAWINGS. On or before the date set forth in Schedule
2, Tenant, the Architect and the Engineers shall complete the architectural and
engineering drawings for the Premises, and the final architectural working
drawings in a form which is complete to allow subcontractors to bid on the work
and to obtain all applicable permits (collectively, the "Final Working
Drawings") and shall submit the same to Landlord for Landlord's approval.

        3.4 PERMITS. The Final Working Drawings shall be approved by Landlord
(the "Approved Working Drawings") prior to the commencement of the construction
of the Tenant Improvements. Tenant shall immediately submit the Approved Working
Drawings to the appropriate municipal authorities for all applicable building
permits necessary to allow "Contractor," as that term is defined in Section 4.1
of this Tenant Work Letter, below, to commence and fully complete the
construction of the Tenant Improvements (the "Permits"), and, in connection
therewith, Tenant shall coordinate with Landlord in order to allow Landlord, at
its option, to take part in all phases of the permitting process and shall
supply Landlord, as soon as possible, with all plan check numbers and dates of
submittal and obtain the Permits on or before the date set forth in Schedule 2.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 3.4, Tenant
hereby agrees that neither Landlord nor Landlord's consultants shall be
responsible for obtaining any building permit or certificate of occupancy for
the Premises and that the obtaining of the same shall be Tenant's
responsibility; provided however that Landlord shall, in any event, cooperate
with Tenant in executing permit applications and performing other ministerial
acts reasonably necessary to enable Tenant to obtain any such permit or
certificate of occupancy. No changes, modifications or alterations ("Tenant
Change")in the Approved Working Drawings may be made without the prior written
consent of Landlord. Landlord shall within three (3) business days after receipt
of request therefor, either (i) approve the Tenant Change, or (ii) disapprove
the Tenant Change and deliver notice to Tenant specifying in detail the reasons
for Landlord's disapproval; provided, however, that Landlord may only disapprove
of the change if the Tenant Change would result in (i) an adverse effect upon
the structural integrity

of the Building; (ii) non-compliance with any applicable law or regulation;
(iii) an adverse effect on the systems and equipment of the Building; or (iv) an
adverse effect on the exterior appearance of the Building. .

        3.5 TIME DEADLINES. Tenant shall use its best, good faith, efforts and
all due diligence to cooperate with the Architect, the Engineers, and Landlord
to complete all phases of the Construction Drawings and the permitting process
and to receive the permits, and with Contractor for approval of the "Cost
Proposal," as that term is defined in Section 4.2 of this Tenant Work Letter, as
soon as possible after the execution of the Lease, and, in that regard, shall
meet with Landlord on a scheduled basis to be determined by Landlord, to discuss
Tenant's progress in connection with the same. The applicable dates for approval
of items, plans and drawings as described in this Section 3, Section 4, and any
other dates for approval required by this Tenant Work Letter, are set forth in
Schedule 2 attached hereto (the "Time Deadlines"). Tenant agrees to use its best
good-faith efforts and all due diligence to comply with the Time Deadlines.

                                    SECTION 4

                     CONSTRUCTION OF THE TENANT IMPROVEMENTS

        4.1 CONTRACTOR. The general contractor in charge of construction shall
be Ticor Construction.

        4.2 COST PROPOSAL. After the Approved Working Drawings are signed by
Landlord and Tenant, Tenant shall provide Landlord with a cost proposal in
accordance with the Approved Working Drawings, which cost proposal shall
include, as nearly as possible, the cost of all Tenant Improvement Allowance
Items to be incurred by Tenant in connection with the design and construction of
the Tenant Improvements (the "Cost Proposal"). Within three (3) business days of
the delivery by Tenant to Landlord of the Cost Proposal, or earlier if
reasonably elected by Landlord and Tenant, Landlord shall be released by Tenant
to purchase the items set forth in the Cost Proposal and to commence the
construction relating to such items. The date by which Tenant must approve and
deliver the Cost Proposal to Landlord shall be known hereafter as the "Cost
Proposal Delivery Date".

        4.3 CONSTRUCTION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS BY CONTRACTOR UNDER THE
SUPERVISION OF LANDLORD.

               4.3.1 OVER-ALLOWANCE AMOUNT. Tenant shall be responsible for the
payment of an amount (the "Over-Allowance Amount") equal to the difference
between (i) the amount of the Cost Proposal and (ii) the amount of the Tenant
Improvement Allowance. Tenant shall pay pro-rata portions of the Over-Allowance
Amount, together with Landlord's disbursement of the Tenant Improvement
Allowance on a ratio which shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Over-Allowance Amount, and the denominator of which is the total of the
Over-Allowance Amount and the Tenant Improvement Allowance; i.e., the Tenant
Improvement Allowance and the Over-Allowance Amount shall be disbursed to the
Contractor on a monthly basis upon approval of disbursement of the Tenant
Improvement Allowance under Section 2.2 of this Work Letter. For example, if the
fraction described above is [*], and the total of the invoices from

the Contractor for the month is [*], Tenant shall pay to Landlord within five
(5) business days of request therefor, [*] as the Over-Allowance Amount portion
of the invoice, and Landlord shall pay [*] as the Tenant Improvement Allowance
amount of such invoice. In the event that, after the Cost Proposal Delivery
Date, any revisions, changes, or substitutions shall be made to the Construction
Drawings or the Tenant Improvements, any additional costs which arise in
connection with such revisions, changes or substitutions or any other additional
costs shall be paid by Tenant pursuant to the payment procedures described
above, as an addition to the Over-Allowance Amount.

               4.3.2 LANDLORD'S RETENTION OF CONTRACTOR. Landlord shall
independently retain Contractor, on behalf of Tenant, to construct the Tenant
Improvements in accordance with the Approved Working Drawings and the Cost
Proposal and Landlord shall retain CB Richard Ellis as Landlord's construction
manager to supervise the construction by Contractor. Tenant shall pay a
construction supervision and management fee (the "Landlord Supervision Fee") to
Landlord in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the product of [*] of the
actual construction cost of the Tenant Improvements and (ii) [*]. There shall be
no other Landlord or supervisory fees associated with the Tenant Improvements
and/or subsequent alterations thereto. All Tenant Improvement costs shall be
documented on an open book basis.

               4.3.3 TENANT'S COVENANTS. Within ten (10) days after completion
of construction of the Tenant Improvements, Tenant shall cause Contractor and
Architect to cause a Notice of Completion to be recorded in the office of the

appropriate sign-offs and permits for the legal occupancy of the Premises have
been received from the applicable governmental authorities.

        5.2 DELAY OF THE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE PREMISES. Except as
provided in this Section 5.2, the Lease Commencement Date shall occur as set
forth in the Lease and Section 5.1 of this Tenant Work Letter, above. If there
shall be an actual delay or there are any actual delays in the Substantial
Completion of the Premises or in the occurrence of any of the other conditions
precedent to the Lease Commencement Date, as set forth in the Lease, as a
direct, indirect, partial, or total result of any of the following acts or
omissions which are under the control of Tenant or agents of Tenant, after
taking into account the "net critical path" effect of delays caused by Landlord
(as defined below) and any event of Force Majeure and after Tenant has received
written notice from Landlord identifying any of the following and one business
day has elapsed after receipt of such notice to allow Tenant an opportunity to
cure the same (a "Tenant Delay"):

               5.2.1 Tenant's failure to comply with the Time Deadlines;

               5.2.2 Tenant's failure to timely approve any matter requiring
Tenant's approval;

               5.2.3 A breach by Tenant of the terms of this Tenant Work Letter
or the Lease;

               5.2.4 Changes in any of the Construction Drawings after
disapproval of the same by Landlord or because the same do not comply with Code
or other applicable laws;

               5.2.5 Tenant's request for changes in the Approved Working
Drawings;

               5.2.6 Tenant's requirement for materials, components, finishes or
improvements which are not available in a commercially reasonable time given the
anticipated date of Substantial Completion of the Premises, as set forth in the
Lease, or which are different from, or not included in, the Standard Improvement
Package;

               5.2.7 Changes to the Base, Shell and Core required by the
Approved Working Drawings; or

               5.2.8 Any other acts or omissions of Tenant, or its agents, or
employees;

then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Lease or this
Tenant Work Letter and regardless of the actual date of the Substantial
Completion of the Premises, the Lease Commencement Date shall be deemed to be
the date the Lease Commencement Date would have occurred if no Tenant Delay or
Delays, as set forth above, had occurred.

        For the purposes of this Tenant Work Letter, "Landlord Delay" shall mean
any actual delays to extent resulting from the acts or omissions of Landlord,
including, without limitation, (i) failure of Landlord to timely approve or
disapprove the Architect/Construction Drawings, the Final Space Plan, the Final
Working Drawings or a Tenant Change; (ii) material interference by Landlord, its
agents or contractors with the completion of the Tenant Improvements and which
objectively preclude construction of Tenant Improvements in the Premises by any
person, which interference relates to access by Tenant, its agents and
contractors to the Premises, Building or

Project or any facilities (such as elevators or parking areas) during normal
construction hours, or activities required pursuant to this EXHIBIT B during
normal business hours (subject to the requirements of Section 6.1 below); (iii)
delays due to the acts or failure to act of Landlord, its agents or contractors
with respect to payment of the Tenant Improvement Allowance and/or cessation of
work upon the Tenant Improvements as a result thereof; and (iv) Landlord's
failure to substantially complete and deliver the Base, Core and Shell in
compliance with Section 1.1 hereof.

        5.3 OUTSIDE DATES. The dates set forth in Schedule 2 hereto contemplate
Substantial Completion by [*], and toward that end, the Contractor has generated
a critical-path schedule which has been delivered to Landlord and Tenant. Such
critical path schedule reflects a date of [*] as the date by which a certain
portion of the Tenant Improvements is to be "walked through" in order to
determine whether the Tenant Improvements are on schedule for Substantial
Completion by [*], during which "walk-through" Landlord and Tenant will develop
a punch list (the "[*] Walk Through"). If the [*] Walk Through does not occur by
[*], Base Rent shall be abated, following the Commencement Date, on a
day-of-Rent for day-of-delay basis for up to two (2) weeks, and thereupon Base
Rent shall be abated on a two-day-of-Rent for day-of-delay basis for a total
abatement period equal the number to date between [*] and the date of the Walk
Through. Further if there is not Substantial Completion by [*], Tenant shall
have the right to request that the Contractor certify to both parties as to the
projected date of Substantial Completion. If within five (5) business days
following such request, Contractor is unable for any reason to certify that
Substantial Completion will occur by [*], then Tenant shall have ten (10)
business days to notify Landlord that it has elected to terminate this Lease,
and if Tenant has timely notified Landlord of its election, Tenant may so
terminate and shall be released from all obligation under the Lease. All dates
prior to [*] shall be extended by Tenant Delays and Force Majeure, and all dates
from [*] shall be extended only for Tenant Delays.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        6.1 TENANT'S ENTRY INTO THE PREMISES PRIOR TO SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION.
Provided that Tenant and its agents do not interfere with Contractor's work in
the Building and the Premises, Contractor shall allow Tenant access to the
Premises prior to the Substantial Completion of the Premises for the purpose of
Tenant installing overstandard equipment or fixtures (including Tenant's data
and telephone equipment) in the Premises. Prior to Tenant's entry into the
Premises as permitted by the terms of this Section 6.1, Tenant shall submit a
schedule to Landlord and Contractor, for their approval, which schedule shall
detail the timing and purpose of Tenant's entry. Tenant shall hold Landlord
harmless from and indemnify, protect and defend Landlord against any loss or
damage to the Building or Premises and against injury to any persons caused by
or arising out of Tenant's actions taken or inaction with respect to the early
entry described in this Section 6.1.

        Tenant shall faithfully observe and comply with the following Rules and
Regulations. Landlord shall not be responsible to Tenant for the nonperformance
of any of said Rules and Regulations by or otherwise with respect to the acts or
omissions of any other tenants or occupants of the Project. In the event of any
conflict between the Rules and Regulations and the other provisions of this
Lease, the latter shall control. The following Rules and Regulation shall be
enforced on a good-faith, nondiscriminatory basis by Landlord, taking into
account Tenant's permitted use, the size of Tenant's Premises relative to those
of other tenants in the Building, and the fair application of the custom and
practice with respect to similar rules and regulations in effect for
institutionally-owned Comparable Buildings. The provisions of the foregoing
sentence may not be revised pursuant to Landlord's right to revise or modify
these rules and regulations.

        1. Tenant shall not alter any lock or install any new or additional
locks or bolts on any doors or windows of the Premises without obtaining
Landlord's prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Tenant shall bear the cost of any lock changes or repairs required by
Tenant. Two keys will be furnished by Landlord for the Premises, and any
additional keys required by Tenant must be obtained from Landlord at a
reasonable cost to be established by Landlord. Upon the termination of this
Lease, Tenant shall restore to Landlord all keys of stores, offices, and toilet
rooms, either furnished to, Tenant and in the event of the loss of keys
furnished by Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the cost of replacing same
or of changing the lock or locks opened by such lost key if Landlord shall deem
it reasonably necessary to make such changes.

        2. All doors opening to public corridors shall be kept closed at all
times except for normal ingress and egress to the Premises.

        3. Landlord reserves the right to close and keep locked all entrance and
exit doors of the Building during such hours as are customary for comparable
buildings in the vicinity of the Project. Tenant, its employees and agents must
be sure that the doors to the Building are securely closed and locked when
leaving the Premises after the normal hours of business for the Building. Any
tenant, its employees, agents or any other persons entering or leaving the
Building at any time when it is so locked, or any time when it is considered to
be after normal business hours for the Building, may be required to sign the
Building register. Access to the Building may be refused unless the person
seeking access has proper identification or has a previously arranged pass for
access to the Building. Landlord will furnish passes to persons for whom Tenant
requests same in writing. In case of invasion, mob, riot, public excitement, or
other commotion, Landlord reserves the right to prevent access to the Building
or the Project during the continuance thereof by any means it deems appropriate
for the safety and protection of life and property.

        4. Tenant shall use its best efforts to give Landlord prior notice
before furniture, freight or equipment of any kind shall be brought into the
Building without prior notice to

Landlord. When possible, all moving activity into or out of the Building shall
be scheduled with Landlord and done only at such reasonable time and in such
manner as Landlord designates. Landlord shall have the right to prescribe the
weight, size and position of all safes and other heavy property brought into the
Building and also the times and manner of moving the same in and out of the
Building. Landlord will not be responsible for loss of or damage to any such
safe or property caused by Tenant, its agents or employees. Any damage to any
part of the Building, its contents, occupants or visitors by moving or
maintaining any such safe or other property caused by Tenant, its agents or
employees, shall be the sole responsibility and expense of Tenant.

governmental agency law, statute, ordinance, standard, rule, or order now in
effect or hereafter issued, and Tenant's signage rights more particularly
described in Paragraph 23 of the Lease, no sign, advertisement, notice or
handbill shall be exhibited, distributed, painted or affixed by Tenant on any
part of the Premises or the Building without the prior written consent of the
Landlord. Tenant shall not disturb, solicit, peddle, or canvass any occupant of
the Project and shall cooperate with Landlord and of Landlord to prevent same.
This clause is drafted in an overly broad which would appear to prohibit
displays of wage -hour regulations, etc. In addition, it needs to be revised to
properly indicate its interaction with Paragraph 23 of the Lease.

        8. The toilet rooms, urinals, wash bowls and other apparatus shall not
be used for any purpose other than that for which they were constructed, and no
foreign substance of any kind whatsoever shall be thrown therein. The expense of

be borne by the tenant who, or whose servants, employees, agents, visitors or
licensees shall have caused same.

nails or screws, or drill into the partitions, woodwork or drywall or in any way
deface the Premises or any part thereof without Landlord's prior written consent

nothing herein shall limit Tenant's right to install art work, framed pictures,
whiteboard and similar non-structural items.

                            AND ATTORNMENT AGREEMENT


     THIS AGREEMENT made this ___ day of _________, 2000, between GUARANTY
FEDERAL BANK, F.S.B. (hereinafter called "Mortgagee"), NextCard, Inc.
(hereinafter called "Tenant") and Carlyle Airport Technology Trust (hereinafter
called "Landlord"),

                         W I T N E S S E T H   T H A T:

     WHEREAS, Mortgagee is now or will be the owner and holder of a Deed of
Trust (hereinafter called the "Mortgage") covering the real property described
in Exhibit A and the buildings and improvements thereon (hereinafter
collectively called the "Mortgaged Premises") securing the payment of a
promissory note in the stated principal amount of $________ payable to the order
of Mortgagee, and recorded or to be recorded in the official public record in
the county where the Mortgaged Premises is located;

     WHEREAS, Tenant is the tenant under a lease (hereinafter called the
"Lease") dated _________, 2000, made with Carlyle Airport Technology Trust, as
landlord, covering certain property (hereinafter called the "Demised Premises")
consisting of all or a part of the Mortgaged Premises; and

     WHEREAS, Landlord, Tenant and Mortgagee desire to confirm their
understanding with respect to the Lease and the Mortgage;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
herein contained, Landlord, Mortgagee and Tenant hereby agree and covenant as
follows:

1.   Subordination. The Lease now is, and shall at all times and for all
purposes continue to be, subject and subordinate, in each and every respect, to
the Mortgage, with the provisions of the Mortgage controlling in all respects
over the provisions of the Lease, it being understood and agreed that the
foregoing subordination shall apply to any and all increases, renewals,
modifications, extensions, substitutions, replacements and/or consolidations of
the Mortgage, provided that any and all such increases, renewals,
modifications, extensions, substitutions, replacements and/or consolidations
shall nevertheless be subject to the terms of this Agreement; and in all events
subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

2.   Non-Disturbance. So long as (i) Tenant is not in default (beyond any period
given Tenant to cure such default) in the payment of rent or additional rent or
in the performance of any of the

<PAGE>   86
other terms, covenants or conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be
performed, (ii) the Lease is in full force and effect according to its original
terms, or with such amendments or modifications as Mortgagee shall have approved
in writing, and (iii) Tenant attorns to Mortgagee or a purchaser of the
Mortgaged Premises as provided in Paragraph 3 below, then (a) Tenant's
possession, occupancy, use and quiet enjoyment of the Demised Premises under the
Lease (or any extensions or renewals thereof or acquisition of additional space
which may be effected in accordance with any option therefor in the Lease) shall
not be terminated, disturbed, diminished or interfered with by Mortgagee in the
exercise of any of its rights under the Mortgage, and (b) Mortgagee will not
join Tenant as a party defendant in any action or proceeding for the purpose of
terminating Tenant's interest and estate under the Lease because of any default
under the Mortgage except as required by applicable law.

3.   Attornment. If Mortgagee shall become the owner of the Mortgaged Premises
or if the Mortgaged Premises shall be sold by reason of foreclosure or other
proceedings brought to enforce the Mortgage or if the Mortgaged Premises shall
be conveyed by deed in lieu of foreclosure, then in any such event the Lease
shall continue in full force and effect as a direct Lease between the then owner
of the Mortgaged Premises (who shall succeed to the rights and duties of
Landlord) and Tenant, and Tenants shall attorn to Mortgagee or such purchaser
(as the case may be) upon any such event and shall recognize Mortgagee or such
purchaser (as the case may be) as the Landlord under the Lease. Such attornment
shall be effective and self-operative without the execution of any further
instrument on the part of any of the parties hereto. Tenant agrees, however, to
execute and deliver at any time and from time to time, upon the request of
Landlord or of any holder(s) of any of the indebtedness or other obligations
secured by the Mortgage of any such purchaser, any instrument or certificate
which, in the sole reasonable judgment of the requesting party, is necessary or
appropriate in any such foreclosure proceeding or otherwise to evidence such
attornment.

4.   Obligations and Remedies. If Mortgagee shall become the owner of the
Mortgaged Premises or if the Mortgaged Premises shall be sold by reason of
foreclosure or other proceedings brought to enforce the Mortgage or if the
Mortgaged Premises shall be conveyed by deed in lieu of foreclosure, then in any
such event Mortgagee or such purchaser (as the case may be) shall have the
remedies by entry, action or otherwise in the event of any default by Tenant
(beyond any period given Tenant to cure such default) in the payment of rent or
additional rent or in the performance of any of the other terms, covenants and
conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be performed that Landlord had or
would have had if Mortgagee or such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest
of Landlord. Upon attornment by Tenant as provided in Paragraph 3 above,
Mortgagee or such purchaser shall be bound to Tenant under all the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Lease and Tenant shall have the same remedies
against Mortgagee or such purchaser for the breach of an agreement contained in
the Lease that Tenant might have had under the Lease against Landlord if
Mortgagee or such purchaser had not succeeded to the interest of Landlord;
provided, however, that Mortgagee or such purchaser shall not be liable or bound
to Tenant:


                                      -2-
<PAGE>   87
     (a) for any act or omission of any prior landlord (including Landlord),
     provided that successor landlord shall be obligated to cure any continuing
     default of the prior landlord of which it has received written notice and
     shall be liable for acts or omissions accruing or arising after the earlier
     of Mortgagee's commencement of control and management of the Property or
     the successor landlord's succession to title; or

     (b) for any offsets or defenses which Tenant might have against any prior
     landlord (including Landlord) except for such offsets and defenses relating
     to continuing acts or omissions with respect to which Mortgagee or such
     party has received notice and has failed to cure; or

     (c) for or by any rent or additional rent which Tenant might have paid for
     more than the current month to any prior landlord (including Landlord); or

     (d) by any amendment or modification of the Lease made without Mortgagee's
     consent; or

     (e) for any security deposit, rental deposit or similar deposit given by
     Tenant to a prior landlord (including Landlord) unless such deposit is
     actually paid over to Mortgagee or such purchaser by the prior landlord; or

     (f) for any repairs or replacements to or required by the Demised Premises
     or the Mortgaged Premises arising prior to the date Mortgagee takes
     possession of the Mortgaged Premises; or

     (g) for any moving, relocation or refurbishment allowance or any
     construction of or payment or allowance for tenant improvements to the
     Demised Premises or any part thereof or to the Mortgaged Premises or any
     part thereof for the benefit of Tenant; or

     (h) for the payment of any leasing commissions or other expenses for which
     any prior landlord (including Landlord) incurred the obligation to pay; or

     (i) by any notice given by Tenant to a prior landlord (including Landlord)
     unless a copy thereof was also then given to Mortgagee.

The person or entity to whom Tenant attorns shall be liable to Tenant under the
Lease only for matters arising during such person's or entity's period of
ownership, and such liability shall terminate upon the transfer by such person
or entity of its interest in the Lease and the Mortgaged Premises and the
assumption of such liability by the transferee.

5.   No Abridgment. Nothing herein contained is intended, nor shall it be
construed, to abridge or adversely affect any right or remedy of Landlord under
the Lease in the event of any default by Tenant (beyond any period given Tenant
to cure such default) in the payment of rent or


                                      -3-
<PAGE>   88
additional rent or in the performance of any of the other terms, covenants or
conditions of the Lease on Tenant's part to be performed.

any default notice sent by Landlord under the Lease to Tenant or by Tenant to
Landlord and to promptly send written notice to Mortgagee upon learning of any
default under the Lease by any party to the Lease.

enforceable and is in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; the
Lease has not been amended except as stated herein; the term of the Lease has

Lease; and Tenant, as of this date, has no charge, lien, counterclaim or claim
of offset under the Lease, or otherwise, against the rents or other charges due
or to become due under the Lease.

8.   Rent Payment. If Mortgagee shall become the owner of the Mortgaged
Premises or the Mortgaged Premises shall be sold by reason of foreclosure or
other proceedings brought to enforce the Mortgage or the Mortgaged Premises
shall be conveyed by deed in lieu of foreclosure, Tenant agrees to pay all
rents directly to Mortgagee or such purchaser, as the case may be, in
accordance with the Lease immediately upon notice of Mortgagee or such
purchaser, as the case may be, succeeding to Landlord's interest under the
Lease. Tenant further agrees to pay all rents directly to Mortgagee immediately
upon notice that Mortgagee is exercising its rights to such rents under the
Mortgage or any other loan documents (including but not limited to any
Assignment of Leases and Rents) following a default by Landlord or other
applicable party.

9.   Notice of Mortgage. To the extent that the Lease shall entitle Tenant to
notice of any mortgage or security agreement, this Agreement shall constitute
such notice to the Tenant with respect to the Mortgage and to any and all other
mortgages and security agreements which may hereafter be subject to the terms
of this Agreement.

the nature of the default and giving Mortgagee thirty (30) days from receipt of
such notice to effect cure of the same, or if cure cannot be effected within
said thirty (30) days due to the nature of the default, Mortgagee shall have a
reasonable time to cure provided that it commences cure within said thirty (30)
day period of time and diligently carries such cure to completion; and (ii)
notice to the Landlord under the Lease (oral or written) shall not constitute
notice to Mortgagee.
