               written notice (a "DISPUTE NOTICE") given by one party (a
               "CLAIMANT") to the other, but not before thirty (30) days have
               passed during which the parties have been unable to reach a
               resolution. The Dispute Notice shall be accompanied by (i) a
               statement of the Claimant describing the dispute in reasonable
               detail and (ii) documentation, if any, supporting the Claimant's
               position on the dispute. Within twenty (20) days after the other
               party's (the "RESPONDENT") receipt of the Dispute Notice and
               accompanying materials, the dispute shall be resolved by binding
               arbitration in Hong Kong under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.
               All arbitration procedures pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall
               be confidential and treated as compromise and settlement
               negotiations and shall not be admissible in any arbitration or
               other proceeding.

          (ii) The parties shall agree on a single arbitrator to resolve the
               dispute. If the Parties fail to agree on the designation of an
               arbitrator within a twenty (20)-day period the Hong Kong
               International Arbitration Centre shall be requested to designate
               the single arbitrator. If the arbitrator becomes disabled,
               resigns or is otherwise unable to discharge the arbitrator's
               duties, the arbitrator's successor shall be appointed in the same
               manner as the arbitrator was appointed.

          (iii) Any award arising out of arbitration (i) shall be binding and
               conclusive upon the parties; (ii) shall be limited to a holding
               for or against a party, and affording such monetary remedy as is
               deemed equitable, just and within the scope of this Agreement;
               (iii) may not include special, indirect, incidental,
               consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages or
               diminution in value; (iv) may in appropriate circumstances
               include injunctive relief; and (v) may be entered in a court.

          (iv) Arbitration shall not be deemed a waiver of any right of
               termination under this Agreement, and the arbitrator is not
               empowered to act or make any award other than based solely on the
               rights and obligations of the parties prior to termination in
               accordance with this Agreement.

          (v)  The arbitrator may not limit, expand or otherwise modify the
               terms of this Agreement.

     (c)  Each party shall bear its own expenses incurred in any arbitration or
          litigation, but any expenses related to the compensation and the costs
          of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties to the
          dispute.

     and expenses incurred in the preparation, negotiation and execution of this
     Agreement.

15.9 Severability. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to be
     unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be excluded from
     this Agreement and the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if
     such provision was so excluded and shall be enforceable in accordance with
     its terms.

15.10 Language. This Agreement shall be executed in both the English and Chinese
     languages and in the event of any discrepancy between the two versions the
     parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the discrepancy
     provided that if such good faith negations do not resolve in a resolution
     then the English version of this Agreement shall prevail.
